Youths launch campaign for dowry-free marriage
A campaign for dowry-free marriage has been launched in Dilpasha union under Bhangura upazila, thanks to the initiative of some local youths and the chairman of the union.

The body of Alo was sent to the Narayanganj General Hospital morgue for an autopsy.

Being disgusted, Khuku along with three daughters, came to her parents' house at Uttar Bhatkhawa village under Dewanganj upazila about a week ago, Lovely said.

Contacted, Bakshiganj police station officer in-charge (OC) Fazlul Karim said they recovered the body and sent it to Jamalpur General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

This interesting news item from Patna in India was published in the pages of a local English daily on May 18th.

It adds a new twist to the saga of dowry demands; common in India!

Portable Gen-Sets are a new item in the menu of dower demands claimed by the groom's parents, in power starved state of Bihar in India!

Considering the bleak power situation in Bangladesh now, may be this could be an interesting idea for prospective groom's parents in negotiating the items for dowry for marriage of their son.

Most of our illegal trade is with India through the porous border.

In fact, roughly 70 percent of the total imports from India come through land ports in western and eastern zones to convey the message that most of the smuggling between Bangladesh and India is through land ports.

Not only Bangladesh, but other countries are also scared of bootleg smuggling of alcohols, tobacco, drugs etc.

If one could carry some cartons of cigarettes from US to Canada, the costs of travel could easily be recouped.

Or a few bottles of wine from France to England might allow a comfortable stay in London.

Historically, Bangladesh's illegal imports from India have hovered around 30 times more that its illegal exports to India.

My research a couple of years back on smuggling showed that, of the total illegal imports from India, 70 per cent is "technical smuggling" and only 30 percent is "bootleg smuggling."

If illegal imports from India are 70 percent of legal trade, then total illegal trade can be approximated at $1.4 billion per year.

By consuming smuggled goods of bootleg type, we are in fact paying taxes to the Indian government.

Such smuggled goods carry central and state taxes of India at retail level.

Had these been formalised through legal imports, there would be no such taxes from Indian side and Bangladesh government would get taxes through tariffs.

Wife strangled for dowry in Barisal
A woman was strangled by her husband for dowry at Hizla-Gourabdi in Hizala upazila yesterday, police and locals said.

Police recovered the body at noon and sent it to Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital morgue for autopsy.

Nila was married to one Akbar Hossain, an ex-expatriate from Saudi Arabia.

Today, March 3rd, I read another sad story in the Daily Star, about a 22 years old housewife, with a 3 year old, child who died at Dhaka Medical College hospital on February 22.

After six months, Manik and his family demanded Tk One lakh again for sending Manik to Saudi Arabia.

These sorts of news reports from Bangladesh are the worst sorts of criminal stories one can read about in the Bangladeshi media.

We know life is tough and poverty is rampant but Bangladesh was never such a land of criminals as it is today than it was, say 35 years ago, even though economically the country is much better off than it ever has been.

Corruption and criminality seem to be the way of life in Bangladesh.

Let Bangladesh government and the civil society ponder for a while, and let them do something to cure, at least, the two above mentioned diseases.

But in a country like Bangladesh, and when acid throwing and setting fire to women have become common, I strongly recommend that capital punishment be the only punishment for such crimes.

Girls from Bangladesh's Hindu community were the victims of this crime for centuries.

There should be laws, if there are no such laws as yet in Bangladesh, that forbid acid throwing, setting fire and dowry taking.

It is time that Bangladesh learns to respect and protect her woman folk.

Housewife murdered for dowry
A housewife was killed by her husband and in-laws allegedly for dowry in Sarishabari upazila of the district on Wednesday.

Police arrested Farid and his elder sister Moyna Begum from the house suspecting their involvement in the killing, said Officer-in-Charge (OC) Rezaul Islam of Sarishabari Police Station.

Deceased's family members said Rabeya' father Moyen Uddin of Sharsha upazila in Jessore paid Farid Tk 1.5 lakh during their marriage three years ago.

While there have been ample studies done by social and economic groups to discover the mystery, in rural Bangladesh this can sometimes turn out to be very little.

Many Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal, follow the practice of dowry.

The social customs in Bangladesh are such that in the 21st century a husband consumed by greed can brutally murder his wife when her family cannot meet the dowry demand.

We read and hear about horrific dowry-related deaths in Bangladesh.

This is happening today in Bangladesh.

It is well documented that since the independence of Bangladesh the dowry problem has become more acute.

Despite the passing of such laws dowry related violence has increased in Bangladesh.

Housewife murdered for dowry
A housewife was killed allegedly by her husband for dowry at Borhanpur village under Madhabpur upazila of Habiganj on Tuesday.

Family members took him to Madhabpur Upazila Health Complex, where the doctors declared her to dead.

Petrol bomb on bus again
Eight people were burned, two of them badly, in Comilla yesterday in a mindless petrol bomb attack on a running bus, bringing to mind the disturbing images of such attacks during the BNP-led opposition's countrywide blockade early this year.

The attack near Bangladesh Jute Research Centre on Dhaka-Chittagong highway at Chandina happened around midnight, when most of the people were offering Shab-e-Barat prayers.

Police detained two local Jamaat leaders for questioning, said Shah Abid Hossain, superintendent of Comilla police.

They are taking treatment at the intensive care unit of the burn unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

Zahirul Islam and Lovely Akhter, a couple from Narayanganj, took primary treatment at Comilla Medical College Hospital, Comilla police said quoting doctors there.

Meanwhile, officials of police, Rab and Border Guard Bangladesh held a meeting at Chandina Police Station in the afternoon and decided to launch a joint operation to hunt down the attackers, reports a Comilla correspondent.

The 24-year-old victim, Radharani Chowhan seemed to have stopped talking as The Daily Star correspondent visited her at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH) where she has been undergoing treatment.

Daughter of late Harilal Chowhan, of Kacharipara in Nalitabari upazila of Sherpur district, Radha married Arun Chowhan, son of Sreeprasad Chowhan of Haluaghat upazila in Mymensingh, nearly six years ago.

Hearing Radha scream, people from the neighbourhood rushed to the spot and took her to Haluaghat Upazila Health Complex.

She was immediately shifted to the MMCH as her condition was critical, Sanjib said, adding that Arun himself took her to Mymensingh but after her admission to the hospital, he fled.

Meanwhile, Sanjib lodged a case with Haluaghat Police Station against Arun's father Sreeprasad, mother Joysna Chowhan and younger brother Barun Chowhan.

The arrestees were then produced before a Mymensingh court that sent them to jail.

DOWRY IN BANGLADESH

The practice of dowry is one of the most evil forms of social ills to pervade Bangladeshi society.

Bangladesh, where a quarter of the 160 million population lives below $2 per day, poverty, lack of education and the low status of women are inherently tied to one another.

Dowry in South Asia and in Bangladesh can be classified into three categories.

In Bangladesh's context, dowry includes money, jewellery, furniture, household items, cars, apartment, land, expenses, etc, either paid voluntarily or on demand to the groom's family.

CHILD MARRIAGE AND DOWRY

The spate of dowry-related deaths and torture cannot be separated from the epidemic of child marriage in Bangladesh.

UNICEF ranks Bangladesh fourth highest in the world when it comes to the rate of child marriage.

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods and droughts are a common occurrence in Bangladesh and it's not uncommon for the poverty-stricken, who are particularly vulnerable to such phenomena, to lose their livelihood, land, and property in the aftermath of such unfortunate events.

As per the draft law, one would face maximum life-term sentence or up to 12 years' imprisonment and fine for seriously hurting a woman over dowry, Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam told reporters after the cabinet approved the proposed law at its weekly meeting at the Bangladesh Secretariat.

Mitali Jahan of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) said there are already such provisions of punishments in the Women and Children Repression Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) about provoking someone to commit suicide or injuring someone.

Brutalities for dowry
It is unfortunate that after long 45 years of Independence, Bangladeshi women are still facing various forms of gender discrimination and gender-based violence in their everyday life.

In the most recent case a man cut off his wife's tongue and slashed the tendon of her left leg for Tk 5 lakh dowry in Sylhet.

The statistics along with the shocking tale of brutality speak aloud about the vulnerability of Bangladeshi women in the domestic sphere.

'JMB's bomb expert' arrested in city
Rapid Action Battalion claimed to have arrested an improvised explosive device (IED) expert of Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in the capital's Uttara early yesterday.

Son of a late civil engineer of Comilla's Burichang, Mushfiqur got admitted to computer science and engineering department at Buet in 2005, but did not complete his studies.

The 15 JMB men's target was a government establishment near Dhaka Cantonment, Jahangir claimed.

Following the arrest of his associates, Mushfiqur went into hiding in Sylhet and Brahmanbaria, said Rab.

On information, a team of Rab-10 arrested him from his house in Sector-12 of Uttara around 8:30am.

Responding to a question whether Mushfiqur had any connection with the bomb explosion near Atia Mahal during army-led Operation Twilight in Sylhet, the Rab official said they would interrogate him about the issue.

Dipak Kumar Das, a sub-inspector of the Detective Branch of police, who headed the investigation into the case, filed the report with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate�s Court of Dhaka this afternoon.

The joyous celebration of the Bangalee's biggest festival -- Pahela Baishakh -- was tainted by incidents of sexual assault on women on the Dhaka University campus on the evening of April 14 this year, sparking widespread public outrage.

Witnesses said some 30 to 40 rowdy youths assaulted and sexually harassed around 20 women for about one hour at the Suhrawardy Udyan gate near the TSC area around 6:00pm.

However, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mohammad Asaduzzaman Miah claimed no incident of sexual assault took place on the campus on Tuesday.

DMP installed around 19 CCTV cameras in the Shahbagh area with three to four cameras positioned right around the spot, said Sirajul Islam, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station.

Liton Nandi, president of Bangladesh Chhatra Union's DU unit, said a group of youths tore off almost the whole of a 25-year-old woman's clothes in front of the Suhrawardy Udyan gate.

One-third of Japanese working women sexually harassed: survey
One-third of Japanese working women have experienced sexual harassment at their place of employment, though nearly two-thirds of these women suffer in silence, a survey has showed.

The results of the first-of-its-kind study commissioned by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to support working women to kickstart the country's struggling economy.

Economists have said for years that Japan needs to make better use of its well-educated but underemployed women, which could go a long way toward plugging the country's labour gap as the country faces an ageing and declining population.

In speech after speech, Abe has urged the country to open up to "womenomics", encouraging some of Japan's biggest firms -- including Toyota, Panasonic and All Nippon Airways -- to announce targets for boosting the number of female executives.

Japan was ranked 101 out of 145 in the Global Gender Gap Index 2015, released by World Economic Forum, lower than Suriname and Azerbaijan.

Following the case filed by an AUST alumnus, Kalabagan police arrested him the same day.

An allegation of sexual harassment to four girl students of Kandirhat High School in Pirgacha upazila was brought against their teacher Nurul Haque, also Ameer of Kandi union unit of Jamaat-e-Islami.

Kandirhat High School assistant teacher Nurul Haque allegedly harassed the four students of class X of the school on different days after private tuition at his house.

Dhaka University as an independent body, it could take necessary steps to prevent such occurrences to ensure a secure environment for female students, said Executive Director of Steps Towards Development Ranjan Karmakar.

The survey, jointly done by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and United Nations Population Fund, covered all the seven divisions of the country.

"My friend was nearly raped the other day," said Shejuti Hridi, a student at a Chittagong university.

Asked for her comments, Ayesha Khanam, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said women's attire was not the issue here.

Ruma, an official in a private company in the capital, said she nearly broke down in tears on a bus recently because when she tried to get a seat reserved for women from a man occupying it, he flung degrading comments at her.

Anamika Alam of Barabkunda village of Sitakunda in Chittagong told The Daily Star that the situation was just the same in the villages.

Street Harassment is Still Serious:

The violation of women in

Dhaka's public realm



Sexual harassment on the streets is also a form of violence, argues OLINDA HASSAN.

Zahedul I Khan The laws governing violence against women have made their presence in Bangladesh.

Violence against women has a history in Bangladesh.

It is also something that women face worldwide; The Egyptian Center for Women's Rights reported that 83% of their women faced street harassment at least once in their life, and similar statistics were found for South Africa, Mexico and France, to name a few.

With urbanisation and the rapid population growth in Dhaka, women inevitably become more prominent in the streets.

This trend is certainly a triumph in the modern women's movement of Bangladesh.

It is very evident therefore, that the ratio of the two genders in the streets of Dhaka is still overwhelmingly in favour of men.

As one male student in his third year at Dhaka University (anonymous) explained after asking him about street harassment, �these women are not supposed to be in the streets, so of course they are going to get harassed.

Bryony Beynon from London of HollaBack, a worldwide technology-driven anti-harassment movement that first began in New York explained to The Guardian (March 8, 2011) how "people need to understand that street harassment has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with power."

Aisha Zakira, the founder of HollaBack in Mumbai in their press release explained how street harassment incidents �are rarely reported, and are culturally accepted as 'the price you pay' for being a woman and living in a city like Mumbai.� She further went on to explain how this type of violence is a �gateway crime� which creates a �cultural environment which makes gender-based violence okay,� and how while a legal method exists in countries like India and Bangladesh to tackle abuse at work or home, �when it comes to the streets -- all bets are off.� Women are also being told to ignore by other women, as commonly observed by mothers and other older female family members.


This question must be asked because, along with violence against women being part of the country's history, oppressing women by forcing preventative measures (such as ignoring violators) have also become rooted in the historical culture of Bangladesh.

Women are increasingly sharing the household income and participating in higher education in Dhaka, a city that is also urbanising at a rapid rate and in a suffocating way.

The consequence of ignorance is the continuation of a type of crime that while it may not be considered violent, is as cruel as any other form of violence against women in Dhaka today.

7 killed in suicide bomb attack at Pakistan court
At least seven people were killed when multiple Taliban suicide bombers attacked a court complex in northern Pakistan yesterday, the latest in a series of assaults which have raised fears militants are regrouping.

The attack was claimed by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) faction of the Pakistani Taliban, which carried out a series of apparently coordinated assaults last week including a powerful bomb blast in Lahore which killed 14 people.

Earlier this month the group vowed a fresh offensive on targets in Pakistan including the judiciary.

Lawyers and the judiciary are frequent targets in Pakistan.

Police and troops had been on high alert in Pakistan after last week's wave of attacks, which killed more than 100 people.

Most, including the Lahore bomb, were claimed by JuA, a faction of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, or Pakistani Taliban) group.

The emergence of IS and a TTP resurgence would be a major blow to Pakistan, which had enjoyed a dramatic improvement in security over the past two years after a military-led crackdown begun in 2014.

Islamabad launched a violent crackdown in the wake of the recent attacks, saying it killed dozens of "terrorists" and carried out strikes on militant hideouts along the border with Afghanistan.

Two detained in Philippines in online child abuse raid: officials
Four minors have been rescued and two suspects detained in the Philippines following a raid on an apartment where children were made to disrobe for Internet cameras, the judicial officials said yesterday.

The Manila raid followed a tip-off from the United States Department of Homeland Security, said Dante Bonoan, anti-human trafficking division chief of the justice department's National Bureau of Investigation.

"The exploited minors were asked to show their sex parts to their clients," he told reporters, adding that the website's paid subscribers were mostly from the United States, Canada and European countries.

Police say the Philippines is a key centre of the fast-growing global industry that streams live images of children forced to commit sex acts for paedophiles abroad, with thousands of children in the impoverished nation abused.

Police in Britain, Australia and the Philippines announced last month that they had jointly dismantled a paedophile ring that streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children as young as six over the web.

In a statement, SNAP said members from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States had travelled to The Hague to urge prosecutors to investigate the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

Alarming rise in child killing






Besides, the body of a minor boy, aged around eight to nine years, was found in an abandoned travel bag in front of Dhaka Medical College Hospital last week.

Bangladesh is no exception to this evil.

In Bangladesh's context, child sexual abuse is still a taboo and seldom gets openly discussed like child labour, trafficking, and exploitation in general.

A joint study conducted by Save the Children and Bangladesh Protibondhi Foundation in 2010 revealed that disabled children are usually at a higher risk of getting sexually harassed as they are unable to protect themselves and even at greater risk are those who are intellectually challenged since they are unable to make out the difference between good and bad touches and are often unable to articulate their concerns.

A seminal and shocking study in the Indian context, "Bitter Chocolate" by Pinki Virani, challenges this belief.

A recent research in India reports that 53% of the children are victims of sexual abuse in some form or the other.

However, one of the biggest challenges that Bangladesh faces in this regard is the lack of professional skills, underscored by lack of institutions providing applied psychology courses, and dearth of professionals working on child psychology.

In 1990, Bangladesh ratified the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which is based on the four general principles of non-discrimination, best interest of the child, right to life, survival and development and right to participation.

Catholic higher-ups in many dioceses including in Ireland and the US were accused of covering up abuse for decades and simply moving alleged abusers from one parish to another.

Hundreds of cases of sexual and physical abuse of youths by priests in recent decades have come to light in Europe and the United States as investigations encourage long-silent victims to finally go public with their complaints.

Benedict himself has been accused of turning a blind eye in 1980, when he was archbishop of Munich in his native Germany, to the case of a priest who was sent there for therapy after sexually abusing children and soon transferred to parish work.

The Vatican has said a subordinate took that decision.

SCREENING CANDIDATES

In his sermon, the 83-year-old pope, who met abuse victims in the United States, Australia and Malta and has decried "sin within the Church," also promised that the Church would enact stronger controls on choosing men who enter the priesthood.


A poll two months ago in Germany showed that a majority of people had lost confidence in the Church and about a quarter of the country's Catholics are considering quitting.

�The law enforcers often show apathy in quickly responding to the incidents.�

He said rebel fighters, Turkish soldiers, and civilians from Al-Bab had called a meeting in Susian "to organise a security apparatus and set a plan for rebuilding al-Bab."

Meanwhile, Turkey said yesterday Turkish armed forces and allied Syrian rebels have completely taken the IS bastion of Al-Bab in northern Syria from jihadists.

The UN's Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura, who brought regime and opposition delegates symbolically together to launch the talks late Thursday, held separate meetings with them yesterday to hammer out the format for the meetings.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was "encouraged that the Syrians ... sat together in the same room," his spokesman in New York said, even if it remains unclear whether the two sides will actually hold face-to-face negotiations.

"While acknowledging that progress will not be easy, (Guterres) believes strongly that only a political solution can bring peace to Syria and that all those Syrians who have committed themselves to this goal should redouble their efforts for peace," he added.

IRAQI FORCE STRIKES IS TARGETS

The Iraqi air force struck Islamic State group targets inside neighbouring Syria, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said yesterday in a statement.

"We ordered the air force command to strike Daesh terrorist sites in Husseibeh and Albu Kamal, in Syrian territory," he said, using an Arabic acronym for the jihadist organisation.

A security official speaking on condition of anonymity said it was the first time Iraq aircraft hunted IS targets across the border with Syria.

Half of UK police forces do not record such cases and many local authorities are also unable to provide figures.

Ibidapo's story: 'I felt like a nobody'

Ibidapo was trafficked to the UK from Nigeria in 2007, to work as a servant for relatives in the North of England.

She escaped with the help of a Nigerian woman living nearby.

Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information (FoI) request reveal that half of UK police forces do not routinely record cases.

Only two forces other than the Met have reported incidents over the last three years: Greater Manchester and Northamptonshire each had one case.

A separate FoI request to local councils across the UK revealed 31 cases where a child had been accused of witchcraft or possession by spirits in 2014 - 30 in England and one in Wales.

She is concerned about the lack of awareness among childcare professionals in the UK.

2 kids tortured inhumanly
In yet another incident of cruelty against kids, two teen boys were tortured badly in Rajshahi over a flimsy claim that they may have stolen a mobile phone.

Zahid, a class-ten student at Bagsara High School, was admitted to Poba Upazila Health Complex and Emon, an orphan, went into hiding in fear, said Shariful Islam, officer-in-charge of Poba Police Station.

Police constable Sagar, who is currently with Rab, and a member of Bangladesh Army, Nasir Uddin, also took part in the beating and were seen in the footage, said the OC, quoting locals.

On July 8 last year, 13-year-old Samiul Alam Rajon was beaten to death by a group of men in Sylhet Sadar allegedly for trying to steal a rickshaw van.

On November 8, a Sylhet court handed down death penalty to four people for the killing.

Then on August 13, Rakib, 13, was tortured to death in Khulna, by his former employer just because the boy quit the job and started working elsewhere for better pay.

They were expert bomb makers
The militants at Atia Mahal were expert bomb makers and the Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) found in the Sylhet den were all homemade, investigators have said.

The detonators of the IEDs were assembled in various militant hideouts in Sitakunda of Chittagong and then brought to the Sylhet den.

The fact that militants were getting hold of the substance came to law enforcers' notice after a police checkpoint came under attack in Comilla on March 7, and the subsequent arrest of two terror suspects, they said asking not to be named.

Officials of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) suspect that large consignments of the gel entered Bangladesh in recent months.

�The entire building has become highly risky as they placed explosives in the staircase and different other places,� he told reporters at Sylhet's Jalalabad Cantonment in the evening.

Police claim �Neo JMB� is an offshoot of the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh (JMB), which carried out several large-scale attacks in 2001-2005.

Musa has become a key leader of �Neo JMB� following the killing of its top leaders, including Tamim Chowdhury, Maj (retd) Jahid and Tanvir Kaderi, in separate operations in Dhaka and Narayanganj, CTTC unit chief Monirul Islam, said on January 7.

Autopsies on the bodies of two militants sent to Osmani Medical College morgue were done yesterday and police collected visceral, DNA and finger prints, said Sohel Ahmed, officer-in-charge of Kotwali Police Station in Sylhet.

But seeing policemen, he must have become too cautious and ended up causing an explosion,� Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia told reporters at the scene.

Meanwhile, one of the accused, Himel, 22, son of Hasan Ali from Joydebpur, was arrested in a drive last night, our Gazipur correspondent reports quoting police authorities.

9 Pakistani Taliban killed in US drone strike
A US drone strike killed at least nine Pakistani militants in Afghanistan�s Nangarhar province early Tuesday, intelligence officials said, part of an intensifying drone campaign against Pakistani militants in Afghanistan.

Tuesday's drone strike was near the site of fierce fighting on the Pakistani side of the border in recent days.

Two Pakistani intelligence officials confirmed Tuesday's strike in the Nazyan area of Nangarhar near Pakistan's Khyber Agency.

They said the nine militants belonged to the Pakistani Taliban and Lashkar-e-Islam, which announced an alliance with the Taliban earlier this month.

No one tracks drone strikes in Afghanistan - many of them take place in remote regions and are not reported - but Taliban commanders say that fighters there are being increasingly targeted since late last year.

The strikes come amid warming relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, traditionally hostile neighbors who each accuse the other of harboring insurgents to act as proxy forces.

Relations improved after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was elected last year.

Pakistan says it is supporting potential peace talks between the Afghan government and Afghan Taliban.

Diplomats hope Pakistan can pressure Afghan Taliban with bases in Pakistan to negotiate.

But Pakistan has also said it wants to see action taken against Pakistani insurgents with bases in Afghanistan.

Air strikes kill 30 militants allied with Pakistani Taliban: sources
Pakistani jet fighters killed 30 militants allied to the Pakistani Taliban in a missile attack in the mountainous northwestern Khyber region today, including the group's spokesman, intelligence officials said.

A U.S. drone strike killed 11 Pakistani Taliban militants in Kunar in northeastern Afghanistan; intelligence officials said on Wednesday, hours after a strike killed at least nine militants in the same area.

"I am sitting here in Kunar along with several other people but our fighters and commanders haven't been killed in a drone strike," Ehsanullah Ehsan, spokesman for the Taliban faction, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan Jamaatul Ahrar, told Reuters.

The Pakistani and Afghan Taliban share a similar jihadist ideology but operate as separate entities.

No one tracks drone strikes in Afghanistan - many of them take place in remote regions and are not reported - but Taliban commanders say that fighters there have been increasingly targeted since late last year.

That was Myanmar, probably 2012.

Here a hapless Rohingya man standing on a boat pleads with his two palms pressed together, crying to be allowed to come ashore, to come to safety from the killer Myanmar army and Buddhist monks.

The same Myanmar army and the same monks are once again cutting through the �most persecuted people� of our time.

And the world blissfully turns a blind eye to the genocide � we call it genocide as every action of the Myanmar government fulfils the criteria of genocide as set by the UN in 1948 -- that is being carried out by Myanmar away from the media's eyes in a tightly controlled fear regime.


.

If they have to get citizenship, they have to show documents of living in Myanmar for at least 60 years.

.

Doesn't it sound very much the Nazi Germany?


The UN has issued a statement that instead of vehemently blaming Myanmar for the wrongs and asking it to immediately stop the genocide rather asked Bangladesh to open its border.

On a milder tone, it just asked Myanmar to protect its civilians in accordance to the �rule of law�.



And the US is too happy to get some access to the close regime.

The Indian Airlines plane, with mainly Indians passengers, had taken off from Nepal on December 24, 1999 and just as it entered Indian airspace, the militants hijacked it to Kandahar in Afghanistan.

United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which coordinates shipping in the Gulf of Aden area, said it had received information that a dhow had been hijacked "in the vicinity of Socotra (Island)".








An Indian government official said the 11 crew were all Indian and that officials were in touch with the Somali government.

In 2011, pirates launched 237 attacks off the coast of Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau, and took hundreds of hostages.

Somalis have been angered by a recent influx of foreign fishermen into their waters, some of whom have been given licences to operate there by the Somali government.

Experts said ship owners were becoming lax after a long period of calm, and that some were using a route known as the Socotra Gap, between Somalia and Socotra Island, regardless of the piracy risks, to save time and cost.

He was on his way to deliver the private car imported by Manten Motors from Japan.

The handcuff inscribed with "police" was handed over to Rampura police later.

Quoting witness, Mahbubur Rahman Talukder, officer-in-charge of Rampura Police Station, said a group of criminals on a white private car waylaid Faruk's golden colour private car near Banasree Central Jame Mosque.

They recovered the body and sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue for an autopsy.

Majid said the two cars then made a u-turn and tried to run over him while heading towards Rampura Bridge at high speed, leaving Faruk in a pool of blood.

Khokon said two drivers, Faruk and Khaza, left Mongla Port with two imported private cars for Dhaka around 8:00pm on Sunday.

"I instructed Khaza to take the car to Naya Paltan and Faruk to Banasree."

Deceased's brother Badsha Kha yesterday filed a case with Rampura Police Station.

According to Fox News, in Tunisia, where the epic season of unrest began, last Sunday's historic elections appear to have resulted in an Islamist group winning a governing majority.

In Libya, an ex-terrorist once jailed by the Central Intelligence Agency, now runs the country's foremost military organisation, while its new political leaders speak openly of enacting Sharia, the ultra-harsh code of Islamic law.

In Egypt, rioters recently forced the evacuation of the Israeli embassy and waged vicious attacks on Coptic Christians.

At a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Thursday, Representative Dan Burton (Republican representing Indiana), told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the Mideast �really worries me,� and asked what the Obama administration �plans to do to make sure we don't have a radical government taking over those places.�

Clinton replied: �Revolutions are unpredictable phenomena.

But, you know, the historic wind sweeping the Middle East and North Africa were not of our making.�

Jamie Smith, a former CIA officer who has made three fact-finding trips to Libya this year, warns that the sense of unity that bound the country's disparate rebel groups during their eight-month revolt has evaporated since Muammar Qaddafi fell from power.

The latter was once head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), which the US State Department classifies as a foreign terrorist organisation.

He suggested Washington can work reasonably well with governments whose legal codes do not mirror our own.

The analysts say US officials are now bracing for a strong showing by the Muslim Brotherhood -- the Islamist group that boasts a long history of organised opposition to the Mubarak regime in Egypt, and whose foreign offshoots include Hamas.

Pak Kashmiri militants 'hijacking' Kashmir talks
The Kashmiri separatist Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) has criticised Pakistani militants for "hijacking" its cause.

The JKLF - which wants Kashmir to be independent of Pakistan and India - said that they were "subverting the indigenous movement".

Lashkar has been at the forefront of the armed insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir in recent years and wants the territory to become part of Pakistan.

Its leaders have since admitted they were then supported by the Pakistani government which trained their militant wing.

A JD spokesman, Yahya Mujahid, told the BBC on Monday that about 3,500 people have joined a JD caravan that will travel from Mirpur to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and then hold a rally in Islamabad on Wednesday.

Pakistan incrminates itself for war crimes in Bangladesh
After Bangladesh recently executed Motiur Rahman Nizami, the head of Jamaat-e-Islami party, for genocide, rape and massacre committed during Bangladesh's War of Liberation in 1971, Pakistan's foreign ministry immediately and vociferously expressed its protest.

Pakistan's National Assembly unanimously condemned Nizami's execution, as if to remind the world that the real perpetrators of the 1971 genocide of Bangladeshis were not lackeys like Nizami, but their Pakistani masters.

This was not the only instance of Pakistan's breach of diplomatic protocol.

Every time Bangladeshi citizens convicted of war criminals of 1971were executed, Pakistan has been one of the only nations to protest.

This time, Turkey also recalled its ambassador to Bangladesh in protest.

This is unfortunate, because Bangladesh did not interfere with Turkey's narrative regarding the Armenian Genocide during WWI.

Pakistanis accepted Pakistan Supreme Court-ordered execution of its former Prime Minister Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto in 1979 for ordering the murder of a political opponent.

Why should Pakistan now object to the execution, after due legal process, of Bangladeshi war criminals of 1971, for aiding abetting, and participating in the murder of lakhs of Bangladeshis, and the rape of thousands of Bangladeshi women, unless Pakistanis themselves felt solely responsible for those crimes?

When it comes to Bangladesh, Pakistan practices its own version of Holocaust denial and continues to behave like unrepentant Nazis.

Pakistan never admitted to the crimes its soldiers committed against Bangladeshis in 1971.

In textbooks Pakistan lies to its children about what really happened in 1971.

Pakistani children are taught that it was all India's fault, and that the rather 'na�ve' Bangladeshis were completely hoodwinked by India's machinations!

My request to the young Pakistanis of the current and future generations is not to believe a word of what a Bangladeshi like me, or a Pakistani, or an Indian says.

Instead, I urge them to research what western newspapers were reporting between March 1971 and December 1971 about Bangladesh's Liberation War.

Read The Times of London, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Washington Post, TIME magazine, Newsweek.and The National Geographic.

They had sent several reporters to Bangladesh to investigate and cover the country's Liberation War.

You will find an unbiased reporting of the atrocities committed by the Pakistani army against Bangladeshi civilians.

For the record, President Richard Nixon and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger vehemently opposed Bangladesh's independence, as did Pakistan's ally China.

However, many in Nixon's State Department, and the majority of Americans, as well as Canadians led by then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and the British and the Australians, supported Bangladesh's independence.

A brief history of the events leading up to Bangladesh's War of Liberation in 1971 is in order here.

After the ouster of Field Marshall Ayub Khan in 1969, Pakistan's new dictator General Yahya Khan scheduled universal franchise-based elections for December 1970.

A cyclone devastated East Pakistan in November.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Awami League won an absolute majority (160 seats out of 300) in Pakistan's National Assembly.

Although Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto's Pakistan's People's Party won only 81 seats, he still declared: �There are two majorities; one in West Pakistan (81), one in East Pakistan(160).� Bhutto should have been imprisoned for treason for that utterance.

At the pretext of negotiating with Mujib in Dhaka, Yahya and Bhutto flew in military reinforcements and unleashed them on unarmed Bangladeshi civilians on the night of March 25, 1971.

(For an authentic, firsthand account of the so-called �negotiations,� read Dr. Kamal Hossain's excellent book, Bangladesh: Quest for Freedom and Justice.

While Pakistani soldiers were the rapists and the murderers, the local Jamaat-e-Islami party and Razakars collaborated with the Pakistan army in their genocide and rape of Bangladeshis.

Not a single demonstration was staged in West Pakistan protesting the genocide of East Pakistanis!

Bangladeshi Muslims are devout, but do not flaunt their Islam.

Fearing for their lives, millions of Bangladeshis crossed into India in 1971 as refugees.

Millions more, including the writer's family, were internally displaced, abandoning their homes to escape the wrath of the marauding Pakistani soldiers.

.

The writer personally knew university professors, intellectuals, physicians and journalists � too many to list here � who were massacred by the Pakistani army.

.

(Fortunately, the Pakistani army ran out of time.)

My future father-in-law, Dr. M. N. Huda, then a Dhaka University professor, was about to be executed at his university residence before Providence intervened.

.

Before releasing Pakistani prisoners of war in 1973, India requested Sheikh Mujib's consent.

Always generous, Mujib agreed on the condition that Pakistan try the 200 war criminals in Pakistan.

Bangladesh gave Pakistan the list of the war criminals, complete with their name, PA number, rank and unit.

No Pakistani soldier was ever tried for genocide against Bangladeshis!

Dr. Nuran Nabi's authentic and well-documented book, Bullets of '71: A Freedom Fighter's Story, (Author House, 2010) depicts an excellent picture of Bangladesh's War of Liberation from a freedom fighter's perspective.

It also lists the names, ranks, PA numbers and units of all 200 war criminals that Bhutto promised to try but never did.

Forty-five years have elapsed since Bhutto's deceitful �promise,� and now it is clear that Pakistan will never try its war criminals.

Bangladesh should hand over the names of those 200 Pakistani war criminals of 1971 to the Hague International Criminal Court, so that they can finally be tried for crimes against humanity.

Sweden truck attack: Man held for 'terrorist crime'
-- You will never ever win, says Swedish PM

A truck ploughed into a crowd on a shopping street and crashed into a department store in central Stockholm on Friday, killing four people and wounding 15 in what the prime minister said appeared to be a terrorist attack.

He was arrested on the highest level of suspicion in the Swedish legal system.

Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported police had detained a second man and that he had a connection to the previously arrested person, citing police sources.

Police said security at Swedish borders had been heightened.

It was trying to hit people," Glen Foran, an Australian tourist in his 40s, told Reuters.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack in Nice, France, last July, when a truck killed 86 people celebrating Bastille Day, and one in Berlin in December, when a truck smashed through a Christmas market, killing 12 people.

"Hijacking a truck, that has happened before," Magnus Ranstorp, head of terrorism research at the Swedish Defence University, told Reuters.

"Our thoughts are going out to those that were affected, and to their families," Sweden's King Carl Gustaf said in a statement, while European Union chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said an attack on any of the bloc's member states "is an attack on us all".

The attack was the latest to hit the Nordic region after shootings in Danish capital Copenhagen in 2015 that killed three people and the 2011 bombing and shooting by far right extremist Anders Behring Breivik that killed 77 people in Norway.

Sweden has not seen a large-scale attack, although in December 2010 a failed suicide bombing killed the attacker only a few hundred yards from the site of Friday's incident.

In February US President Donald Trump falsely suggested there had been an immigration-related security incident in Sweden, to the bafflement of Swedes.

Swedish authorities raised the national security threat level to four on a scale of five in October 2010 but lowered the level to three, indicating a "raised threat", in March 2016.

Police in Norway's largest cities and at Oslo airport will carry weapons until further notice following the attack.

Denmark has been on high alert since the February 2015 shootings.

Traffic was restricted on the Oresund Bridge linking Denmark and Sweden at the request of Swedish police.

Neutral Sweden has not fought a war in more than 200 years, but its military has taken part in U.N. peacekeeping missions in a number of conflict zones in recent years, including Iraq, Mali and Afghanistan.

The Sapo security police said in its annual report it was impossible to say how big a risk there was that Sweden would be targeted like other European cities, but that, if so "it is most likely that it would be undertaken by a lone attacker".

Militants change tactics, govt doesn't
Since the August 17 countrywide synchronised bombings by Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in 2005, a new generation of terrorists have spawned but there has been no change in government tactics to deal with them.

It was in 2005 when banned militant outfit JMB blasted bombs in 63 districts, killing two persons and injuring more than 400, to draw people's attention to its organisational strength and mission to establish Sharia law in Bangladesh.

Last month's arrest of some JMB operatives over a bank robbery in Ashulia and last year's snatching of two condemned JMB leaders from a police van at Trishal prove the organisation is fully operational and a matter of concern for law enforcers.

The outfit is still active in different areas under different names,� said Tangail Superintendent of Police Mahfuzur Rahman, who has years of experience in dealing with militancy.

Prof Ziaur Rahman, chairman of Dhaka University criminology department, said only arrest could not wipe out terrorism.

Jaish-e-Mohammed operative captured




The Rapid Action Battalion arrested a Pakistani national and four locals for suspected links to Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in the city early yesterday.

The Pakistani, Rezwan Ahmed, 26, had been coordinating JeM operations in Bangladesh, said Rab officials.

Of the five, Billal was arrested near the foot-bridge in front of New Market and the rest including Rezwan were rounded up in Sukanya Tower, an apartment block adjacent to Gausia Market on Mirpur Road.

Billal had been jailed in India for involvement in hijacking an Indian Airlines plane in December 1999.

In a pre-dawn raid on a flat in the Sukanya Tower, the crime busters also seized three passports, two of them issued in Pakistan, one knife, one CPU, four national ID cards, five mobile phones and 2,000 Indian rupees.

The passports belong to Rezwan, Billal and another Pakistani named Jawad.

Rab sources said Jawad might have fled to India.

He said his assignment here was to recruit local youths and prepare them to stage attacks in India.

Rezwan and his co-arrestees were paraded before the media at the Rab headquarters in Uttara yesterday afternoon.

Talking to reporters, the Pakistani said he is from Delhi Colony Clifftop in Karachi.

Rab sources said Mohiuddin, now president of Hajiganj union BNP in Chandpur, had earlier been involved in Jamaat-e-Islami.

Billal told journalists that he was arrested in an anti-state case in India.

He also admitted that he had a role in hijacking the Indian Airlines plane, which was flying to Delhi from Kathmandu.

The hijackers forced the aircraft to land in Kandahar of the then Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.

The Indian authorities had to set free three militant leaders including JeM supremo Moulana Masood Azhar in exchange for passengers taken hostage.

Billal said he was born in Darampur village under Sylhet Sadar.

He is married to a woman hailing from Bashirhat of the Indian state of West Bengal.

He said he had tried to enter India through Satkhira border a few months back to appear before a Bashirhat court hearing a case against him.

Along with another militant group, Jaish is blamed for the attack on Indian parliament in Delhi in December 2001.

It is also suspected to have a role in the abduction and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl in Karachi.

After the parliament attack, Pakistan government banned the organisation and the US State Department listed it as a terrorist outfit.

JeM's main objective is to separate Kashmir from India.

Rab officials said Rezwan had been travelling between Bangladesh and India without any valid documents.

Somali pirates hijack Saudi supertanker




In a dramatic escalation of high seas crime, Somali pirates hijacked a Saudi supertanker loaded with crude hundreds of miles off the coast of East Africa defeating the security web of warships trying to protect vital shipping lanes.

Maritime experts warned the broad daylight attack, reported by the US Navy on Monday, was an alarming sign of the difficulty of patrolling a vast stretch of ocean key to oil and other cargo traffic.

The MV Sirius Star, a brand new tanker with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 am Saturday more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the Navy said.

He said the former leader of Islami Chhatra Sangha, the then student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, was involved in the killing of at least 14 people and in two acts of genocide in Faridpur during the war.

About the formation of Razakar and Al-Badr in Faridpur, two auxiliary forces of the Pakistan army, Sahidur said in the first half of May 1971, the Razakar was formed under the leadership of Azad and later the Pakistan army appointed Azad the chief of the Al-Badr force in Faridpur.

Azad and his associates occupied the homes of Badri Narayan, Hira Lal Mukter and Charu Majumder in Faridpur town and Azad himself trained local collaborators there, said the prosecutor.

He said in cooperation with the Pakistan army, Azad committed numerous crimes during the war.

On two incidents of genocide, Sahidur said Pakistani soldiers led by Major Akram Koreshi on April 21, 1971, went to Faridpur and Azad, Afzal Hossain, and Chand Quazi and other leaders of anti-liberation political parties advanced to Goalchamat to receive them.

They killed eight priests of Prabhu Jagatbandhu Ashram as they entered Faridpur town with the Pakistani army, he said.

Narrating another incident, the prosecutor said, in the third week of May, 1971, Azad, some of his cohorts along with 30-35 Pakistani army personnel attacked Hasamdia, a Hindu-dominated neighbourhood of Boalmari in Faridpur.

Azad and his accomplices raped two women in Natibadia of Boalmari upazila in Faridpur and through issuing threats, he and his armed cohorts forced 15-20 Hindus of Sahapara of Nagarkanda upazila to convert to Islam, claimed the prosecutor.

Many Hindus of Faridpur district had to leave the country during the war after becoming victims of Azad's atrocities, he added.

Born-again JMB far more dangerous
Banned in 2005 and subsequently broken down, the Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) took only nine years to reorganise.

Investigators say the Neo JMB is responsible for the July 1 Gulshan caf� siege in which 20 hostages, including 17 foreigners, were killed.

Law enforcers came to know in details about the Neo JMB's network, strength, funding and weapons after the Gulshan and Sholakia attacks and a raid at its Kalyanpur den.

DMP's counterterrorism unit chief Monirul Islam yesterday said that with several of its activists arrested and killed in Gulshan, Sholakia and in Kalyanpur, the Neo JMB has been weakened.

In the July 1 siege at Holey Artisan Bakery in Gulshan, the militants used eight arms, including three semi-automatic AK 22 rifles.

A semi-automatic sniper rifle was also recovered from a den in Chittagong.

The group started underground activities that year to establish Taliban-like rule through jihad, but it grabbed the limelight in April 2004 when it started vigilante operations against underground communist outlaws, popularly known as Sarbaharas, in Rajshahi, Natore, Naogaon and Bogra.

In the early stage of JMB, Rahman communicated with Syed Abdul Karim alias Tunda, who was accused of masterminding over 40 bombings in India.

Rahman had confessed that Tunda, allegedly a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist, was in Dhaka and stayed in Jatrabari area in 1990s.

Under Tunda's arrangement, Rahman visited Pakistan in 1997 along with Tunda.

After being arrested by Rab in 2006, Rahman told law enforcers, �I had contact with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood when I was in Saudi Arabia.

I expressed my interest in setting up Islamic rule in Bangladesh�Upon my return �through setting up a separate jihadi organisation to usher in Islamic rule.�

In 2002, he went to Pakistan again.

In his statement, Rahman said they also had contact with the UK-based organisation al-Muhajirun, headed by the Syrian-origin British national Omar Bakri.

The organisation had requested JMB to train its members in Bangladesh.

After the August 17 blasts, they reportedly phoned JMB leaders, advising them to attack various foreign diplomatic missions in Dhaka, and the Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) and also to abduct and assault important foreign persons.

The group was then called JMJB (Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh).

Still, in November and December, JMB carried out five suicide attacks in Jhalakathi, Chittagong, Gazipur and Netrakona.

END OF KINGPINS

Shaykh Rahman and his family were arrested in Sylhet on March 2, 2006 and Bangla Bhai on March 6 from Mymensingh.

Somali pirates hijack 2 boats as world mulls anti-piracy strategy
Pirates dodged foreign navies and hijacked another two boats even as an international conference here yesterday explored securing one of the world's busiest shipping routes off Somalia.

Somali pirates on Wednesday hijacked two Yemeni fishing boats near the port of Aden, maritime officials said, adding that seven fishermen had managed to escape on a smaller boat.

The latest attack brought to at least 17 the number of ships currently being held by Somali pirates, including an arms-laden Ukrainian cargo and a Saudi-owned super-tanker carrying two million barrels of crude oil.

In his opening remarks, the UN's top envoy for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, called for tough measures against pirates and their backers, and urged greater international commitment to stabilising the country.

Gathered in Nairobi under the aegis of the Kenyan government and the United Nations, representatives of flag, port and coastal states also explored ways of removing some legal obstacles to tougher anti-piracy action.

Piracy "poses an enormous challenge to the international legal system", UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia Mark Bowden said at Wednesday's opening of the conference.

Technical experts gathered Wednesday discussed a document drafted by the Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to enlist the support of Somalia's neighbours in arresting, transferring and prosecuting pirates.

The 1.3-million-dollar programme will boost the criminal justice and law enforcement systems of Kenya, Djibouti, Yemen and Tanzania, over a six-month period to prepare them to try the pirates.





Some participants argued that the cost the EU's naval force -- estimated at 250 million euros (320 million dollars) -- amounted to four or five years of the EU's aid budget for Somalia and could be best spent on rebuilding Somalia's institutions and creating alternative livelihoods.

"They are not realistic and one can only understand it if the Europeans are trying to protect their fleets fishing illegally in Somali waters," said Abdiwahid Mohamed Hersi, head of fisheries, ports and marine resources for the government of Puntland, a northern breakaway state where piracy is rampant.

Terror financed due to HSBC failure




Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd and Social Islami Bank Ltd came into the spotlight yesterday for their alleged links to terrorist financing after a US Senate report exposed British banking giant HSBC's internal governance failure to control flows of suspect funds.

Click here to read Full Text of US report

One of the banks was allegedly funding al-Qaeda, and Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law held shares in a company that has shares in the bank.

More thoughts were given to the bank's making $47,000 in revenue that might go up to $75,000 a year later than to the terrorist links the banks allegedly had, or the US authorities' view of the banks.

A report of the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a congressional watchdog panel, has revealed these troubling information which show a �pervasively polluted� culture at HSBC Holdings Plc.

The bank acted as financier to clients seeking to route shadowy funds from the world's most dangerous and secretive corners, including Mexico, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria, according to the report.

The US report also mentioned that Al Rajhi Bank, a Saudi bank, was involved in suspicious transactions.

HSBC apologised to the US Senate, saying it takes �compliance with the law, wherever it operates, very seriously�.




HSBC's another internal report said a Saudi NGO, International Islamic Relief Organisation (IIRO), had been implicated in terrorist financing by the US government and included on the list of those prohibited to do business in the US.

�Today, although HSBC exited the US banknotes business in 2010, Islami Bank remains a customer of two dozen HSBC affiliates,� the report said.

While the FIG cautioned about opening an account of Social Islami Bank, it failed to inform HSBC that Lajnat al-Birr, whose original name is Benevolence International Foundation, was designated by the US as a �financier of terrorism� with whom US persons are prohibited from doing business.

The FIG of HSBC also cautioned the bank about keeping Social Islami Bank as a client, an advice ignored by the British bank.

According to the US report, HSBC Bank USA, the US affiliate of the Asia-focused bank, supplied US dollars to Islami Bank and Social Islami Bank despite evidence of their links to terrorist financing.

The report said Al Rajhi Bank was associated with Islami Bank Bangladesh that provided an account to a Bangladeshi who had been accused of involvement in a terrorist bombing.

A second shareholder was the precursor to the Benevolence Islamic Foundation, also later designated by the US as a terrorist organisation, said the report.

Alert at Indian airports on plane hijack report

Earlier this week, officials received warnings that militants could attempt to hijack passenger planes to coincide with anniversary of the destruction of the Babri mosque in northern India by Hindu extremists in 1992.

The stepped-up airport security came in response to "fresh intelligence inputs" about the hijack warnings, said Moushmi Chakravarty, spokeswoman for India's civil aviation ministry.

Security was initially increased after the Mumbai attacks last week in which 10 militants targetted multiple locations in India's western financial capital, killing 163 people including 26 foreigners.

Security is traditionally tight across India on the anniversary of the demolition of the Babri mosque.


He said that the other man was from revolt-hit Indian Kashmir, where Islamic militants have been waging a nearly two-decade battle against New Delhi's rule.

The attack by 10 gunmen against multiple targets in Mumbai, including the landmark Taj Mahal hotel, killed 163 people including 26 foreigners.

India 'al-Qaeda' chief arrested
Police in the Indian capital, Delhi, say they have arrested two key members of the "Indian branch" of al-Qaeda.

The group has said it was behind the killings of four secular bloggers in Bangladesh as well as several attacks in Pakistan.

Indian authorities said the two arrested men were involved in recruiting young Indians to the group.

Delhi police say the arrests will provide crucial leads to uncovering the group's operations within India and in neighbouring countries.

The al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri said its regional unit would be good news for Muslims in Myanmar (Burma), Bangladesh and the Indian states of Assam, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir, where they would be rescued from injustice and oppression.

Correspondents say that although al-Qaeda still has no substantial presence on the ground in India, there is concern that it is trying to reach out to disaffected Muslim youth, especially in Kashmir and Gujarat.

Islamic militant groups operating in India have so far been mostly connected to Kashmiri separatists and have links, tenuous at best, to al-Qaeda via Pakistan-based groups.

Pirates hijack Bangladeshi ship in the Arabian sea
Pirates have hijacked a Bangladesh-flagged ship in the Arabian Sea off the coast of India, shipping officials in Dhaka said yesterday.

China rejects UK claims it 'hijacked' climate talks


British climate change minister Edward Miliband's editorial singled out Beijing as the culprit behind the talks' near collapse.

"China has made arduous efforts," she said.

China has said it will cut "carbon intensity," a measure of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of production, by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with levels in 2005.

Top men fled; risk too high


According to the statement of the case filed in this connection, JMB second-in-command for Dhaka region Sohel Rana Hiron and trainer for bomb and grenade making Mostafizar Rahman had cleverly fled the scene blending into tenants who were being taken out of the Mirpur building.

Detectives said Hiron and Mostafizar were key leaders of a faction of Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), which was allegedly involved in some recent attacks, including the one at Hossaini Dalan and two police checkpoints.

Apart from training new recruits at the Mirpur den, Mostafizar used to visit different areas of the country to train recruits and make bombs and grenades as per the organisation's requirements, the police official said.

They claimed that sometimes grenades or bombs were supplied from the Mirpur factory while other times Mostafizar would travel to destinations to make the bombs.

Malaysian Tamils protest Lankan 'genocide'




.

The demonstration by one of the world's largest Tamil communities outside India and Sri Lanka, followed Colombo's declaration of victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) last Monday, amid widespread concern that large numbers of Tamil civilians were killed in the fighting.

Protesters who gathered at the famous Batu Caves Hindu temple, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, say Sri Lanka is preventing full humanitarian assistance from getting through to nearly 300,000 displaced people.

Amid a sea of red LTTE flags emblazoned with a leaping tiger, men dressed in traditional white vejtis and women in sarees with flowers in their hair chanted slogans calling for Sri Lanka's president to be tried for crimes against humanity.

"We condemn the actions of the Sri Lankan government, who, in spite of international pressure, went on to virtually execute 25,000 Tamils in the last 100 days, which can be legally termed as genocide," event organiser S.P.

Federal Territories deputy minister M. Saravanan, who had attended along with opposition leaders, said Malaysia should not support a Sri Lankan-sponsored UN bill on non-interference in the battle-scarred country's affairs.

"The Malaysian government should not support any UN resolutions like this one that is being tabled against the Tamils in Sri Lanka," he told AFP.

Ethnic Indians -- many of whom are descendants of labourers brought over by British colonial rulers in the 1800s -- make up less than eight percent of the 27 million population of this mainly Muslim-Malay country.

Panama Papers: Fifa president Infantino 'dismayed'
Fifa president Gianni Infantino has denied wrongdoing after leaked documents suggested he signed off on a contract with two businessmen who have since been accused of bribery.

News of the contract came to light after 11 million documents were leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

Hugo Jinkis and his son, Mariano, are fighting extradition from Argentina to the United States.

In May 2015, US prosecutors alleged that, as the owners of Cross Trading, they paid millions of dollars in bribes to South American football officials over several years in order to gain lucrative television rights for regional football tournaments.

Cross Trading, an offshore company registered to the tiny Pacific island of Niue, paid $111,000 (�78,000) for those rights.

The cases were filed on charges of amassing wealth beyond know sources of income, concealing information about wealth, cheating, bribery and forgery, ACC Secretary Abu Md Mustafa Kamal said at a briefing at the anti-graft watchdog�s headquarter at Segunbagicha in Dhaka.

Terror kingpin killed


Tamim, who had Tk 20 lakh bounty on his head, was killed along with two accomplices in the operation codenamed �Hit Strong 27� at their hideout in Paikpara of Narayanganj.

Officials, however, rule out any organisational presence of IS in Bangladesh.

Operatives of the banned local outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), who became inactive after Saidur Rahman took over as the chief, formed the �Neo JMB� inspired by IS ideologies.


The operation �Hit Strong 27� came a month after another such raid on a militant hideout in Dhaka's Kalyanpur.

Immediately after officials got the information about Tamim's hideout, a Special Weapon and Tactics (SWAT) team under the counterterrorism unit along with DMP's bomb disposal unit rushed to Narayanganj.

Tarique files petition for quashing bribery case


On October 4 last year, Abul Kashem, deputy assistant director of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), filed the bribery case with Ramna Police Station, accusing six people including former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar.

The ACC on February 26 filed a case against BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and 15 others including Jamaat-e-Islami Amir Motiur Rahman Nizami and Secretary General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed for corruption in awarding operations contract of Barapukuria coal mine to a Chinese firm.

Around 11:00am, Nahid visited the Shikkhha Bhaban and witnessed the allegation of Badrul Hossain, assistant headmaster of Rastarhat Hazi A Gafur High School in Laxmipur.

Monirul was instantly transferred to Rani Nihar Devi Government High School in Khagrachhari following the education minister's order.

The government is recruiting some 10,629 retailers under 1,600 fertiliser dealers appointed by Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) in 85 municipalities and 1,096 unions of northern districts, sources said.

Recruitment of retailers was not possible within the time limit due to differences of opinion among the members of union committees over selecting names, reports our staff correspondent from Rajshahi.

Out of total 774 retailers to be appointed in nine upazilas of Rajshahi, only 45 retailers in Mohonpur and 36 in Bagha upazila have been recruited within October 15, said AED official Dipendra Mohon, who is monitoring the recruitment in the district.

Amid allegations of taking Tk 20,000 as bribe from each retailer in Godagari and Tanore upazilas, lawmaker Omar Faruk Chowdhury called a meeting of all UP chairmen in Rajshahi on Thursday and warned them of stern action if irregularities are found.

Agricultural Extension Department (AED) officials in Natore, Bogra and Naogaon said that they would need two or three days more to complete the recruitment.

Asked about the allegation of bribery against the MP's men in Mohonpur, local lawmaker M Meraj Uddin Mollah said, "I am not aware of what is happening over recruitment.

I am staying in Dhaka.

Most of the union committees in nine upazilas of Pabna district have failed to complete recruitment process of the retailers within the scheduled timeframe, reports our correspondent.

Sources said most of the union selection committees under Vangura, Faridpur and Atghoria upazilas could not finalise the names of retailers yet.

Meanwhile, the local selection committees have submitted the names of retailers to the upazila committees in Sujanagar, Ishwardi, Bera and Santhia upazilas.

When contacted, Deputy Director of Pabna Agriculture Extension Department Md Sanaullah Miah told The Daily Star that they will select the traders as per rule and the process will complete soon.

Our Manikganj correspondent adds: Local people brought out a procession and held a rally at Singair in Manikganj demanding removal of Singair Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md Nazrul Islam for his alleged irregularities in appointing retailers.

Around 2,000 people joined the procession on Singair Pilot High School premises.

Mosharraf charged with bribery




The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday pressed charges against former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain for taking bribe from Niko Resources Ltd, a Canadian energy producer.

Investigation officer (IO) of the case and ACC Assistant Director Shahidur Rahman submitted the charge sheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's court of Dhaka, naming 15 prosecution witnesses and showing Kashem as fugitive.

Chinese and Russian firms fare worst in bribery index
Chinese and Russian firms are the most likely to pay bribes while operating abroad, and the most corrupt sectors are public works contracts and construction, according to Transparency International's latest "Bribe Payers' index".

China and Russia rank bottom, in 27th and 28th place respectively, in the 2011 index released on Wednesday, while the Dutch, Swiss, Belgians, Germans and Japanese get the top scores.

Britain and the United States rank eighth and ninth.

"India's score improved the most, with an increase of 0.7, but it still remai-ns near the bottom of the table.

Canada and the United Kingdom saw the most significant deterioration in their scores with a drop of -0.3," read the report.

"It is of particular concern that China and Russia are at the bottom of the index," it said, citing their increasing global presence, especially in oil and gas in Russia's case and China's investments in infrastructure and mining, in particular in Africa.

Unfair practices, neglect cost TeleTalk Tk 200cr




A task force probe found that Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board's (BTTB's) mobile phone project TeleTalk incurred losses of over Tk 200 crore due to implementation delay, and blamed it on unfair practices and negligence of the then telecom minister and eight high officials of the BTTB.

The estimated cost of the once lucrative public mobile project named '10 lakh T&T Mobile Phone Project' (TeleTalk), was Tk 594 crore.

Recently, the way Siemens won the project contract as lowest bidder was known from a US district court's memorandum narrating the company's corruption in Bangladesh.

The US court said that between 2000 and 2002, BTTB, state-owned telecommunications authority, conducted three open tenders for a mobile telephone project that was ultimately awarded to Siemens.

Teamed up with Siemens Bangladesh and Siemens Mobile Communications S.P.A. (then a Siemens subsidiary located in Milan, Italy), the company ultimately won part of the contract in June 2004.

From May 2001 to August 2006, Siemens Bangladesh engaged or had to engage purported business consultants to bribe government officials for favour during the bidding process, according to the US court report.

The task force investigation report said the project --10 lakh T&T Mobile Phone Project-- was not completed till its last deadline in June 2008.

Militants grow in silence
.

As a rising militant outfit, Ansarullah wanted to launch al-Qaeda in Bangladesh (AQIB) like al-Qaeda in Indian Sub-Continent (AQIS).

But the AQIS headquarters in Pakistan did not approve the idea and suggested Ansarullah be renamed Ansar Al Islam and work as the Bangladesh branch of AQIS.

Tamim, in the latest issue of Dabiq, claimed that a section of Shibir, the student front Jamaat-e-Islami, is also working for his group in Bangladesh.

According to statements of the arrested members of this group, some of its militants are Syrian war returnees.

About a hundred such militants, including women, are now fighting in Syria.

The IS-influenced group has two main wings -- the southern wing based in Mirpur and the northern in Gazipur.

Its operational headquarters are in Savar and Tongi while its training centre is in Mirpur.

Detectives say it was pointless to argue whether there was IS in Bangladesh or not, as the threat of these militant groups was real.

Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit chief Monirul Islam said, �As the situation of militant organisations based in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan has become fragile due to the global situation, they are now more interested in the sub-continent.�

Those who nurture the jihadi ideology were getting involved with these militant groups, he said.

On both pages, it referred to the bribery case of Siemens from where Koko allegedly embezzled several million US dollars, costing the national interest.

On page 53, the handbook said Siemens and its subsidiaries in Argentina, Bangladesh and Venezuela bribed public officials to secure government contracts.

The book on page 196 goes further with the reference of the action of the US Department of Justice stating: "In 2009, the US Department of Justice filed a confiscation action against bribery proceeds paid (in Singapore, with US currency) by a foreign company to the son of the former prime minister of Bangladesh".

Earlier, media reports said the US authorities on January 8, 2009, moved a legal process in a court in the District of Columbia to recover funds worth $3 million, allegedly obtained by Koko from Siemens and kept with a Singapore-based bank.

The World Bank publication was released two weeks after a special Judge Court of Dhaka framed charge against Koko and Ismail Hossain Saimon, son of former shipping minister late Akbar Hossain in the same case.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the case on March 17 last year with the Kafrul Police Station of the city accusing Koko and Saimon of laundering $9 lakh 32 thousand 672 and Singapore $ 28 lakh 84 thousand 604.

The issue of repatriation of siphoned off money surfaced in Bangladesh during the past military-backed interim administration in 2007- 2008 when officials said they estimated millions of dollars were smuggled out by influential but corrupt people.

Former World Bank vice president Praful C Patel at that time said Bangladeshi assets had either been stolen or smuggled outside the country for the last several years while "corruption had eaten up nearly three percent of the country's growth rate".

Bangladeshi, ex-FBI agent charged with bribery scheme
Screenshot of US Justice Department news release on the arrest and court proceedings.

A former FBI agent and two others including a Bangladeshi have been charged in New York with engaging in a bribery scheme to secure confidential, internal law enforcement documents about a prominent individual in Bangladesh.

Rizve Ahmed, 34, a native of Bangladesh also known as Caesar, sought confidential information about a Bangladeshi politician, and to locate and harm him/her and others associated with him/her, according to news release of US Department of Justice.

The release does not mention the name of the Bangladeshi politician whom it identified as "a prominent citizen of Bangladesh who was affiliated with an opposing political party".

They were scheduled to be presented later in the day before US Magistrate Judge George A Yanthis in the federal court in White Plains.

Lustyik is currently detained in connection with an unrelated indictment in US District Court for the District of Utah, where he will be initially presented on the charges in the complaint.

If convicted, Ahmed, of Fairfield County, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Thaler, of Fairfield County, Conn., faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

According to the complaint, from about September 2011 through March 2012, Lustyik, Thaler and Ahmed engaged in a bribery scheme on behalf of Ahmed, who sought confidential law enforcement information about a prominent Bangladeshi who was affiliated with an opposing political party.

As another example, in or about late January 2012, Lustyik, upon learning that Ahmed was considering using a different source to obtain confidential information about the Bangladeshi politician, texted Thaler, "I want to kill [Ahmed] .

Tell [Ahmed], I've got [Bangladeshi politician's] number and I'm pissed.

I will put a wire on n get [Ahmed and his associates] to admit they want [a Bangladeshi politician] offed n we sell it to [Bangladeshi politician]."

The complaint also alleges that Lustyik and Thaler schemed to obtain monthly cash bribes from Ahmed, in increments of tens of thousands of dollars, in exchange for the provision of additional confidential law enforcement information about the individual in Bangladesh and for assistance in having criminal charges against a Bangladeshi political figure dismissed.

China busts 6,200 commercial bribery cases
China busted more than 6,200 cases of commercial bribery involving hundreds of millions of dollars last year, state media reported on Monday.

Regulators this year will keep a close eye for potential corruption emerging from the roll-out of China's four-trillion-yuan economic stimulus package and rebuilding projects of areas hit by last year's earthquake, Xinhua said.

The 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit China's southwest on May 12 last year, leaving up to 88,000 people dead or missing, and billions of dollars have been spent on reconstruction work.

Xinhua said that authorities also vowed to watch for graft in fields such as land transactions and resources exploitation -- two areas that often trigger disputes or even social unrest in China.

ACC to quiz Huda, Sigma in bribery case
A Dhaka court yesterday allowed the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to interrogate detained former communications minister Nazmul Huda and his wife Sigma Huda at jail gate in connection with a case filed against them for taking Tk 6 lakh in bribe from a construction firm.

On June 18, the ACC filed the case with Motijheel Police Station accusing the two of taking Tk 6 lakh in bribe from the owner of Marganet One Ltd.

As per his demand, the owner of the firm deposited Tk 6 lakh to the account of Weekly Khoborer Antorale at Amin Court (Motijheel) branch of Agrani Bank in 20 cheques between September 30, 2004 and October 18, 2006, the case statement said.

Caught in camera
A senior government official is likely to face administrative and legal action after he was filmed taking bribes from service seekers on a number of occasions at his Motijheel office in the capital.

Video clips available on the social media show Md Shahidul Haque, controller at Dhaka office of the Office of Chief Controller of Imports & Exports (CCI&E) under the commerce ministry, counting notes, bargaining with service seekers over bribe and putting the cash in his trouser pocket.

Before being made controller at Dhaka office, he held important positions at the commerce ministry, the Tariff Commission, and the Export Promotion Bureau.

According to the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), corruption is widespread in many government offices, and bribe takers, in most cases, go unprosecuted.

Bangladesh topped the list of corrupt countries published by Transparency International between 2001 and 2005.

And Shahidul led the group that took bribes from service seekers at Dhaka office of the CCI&E.

The head office of the CCI&E is in Motijheel, and it shares the same building with its Dhaka office.

Bribery, anomalies rule recruitment




Yusuf Ali Mridha, the suspended general manager (east) of Bangladesh Railway, had recruited more than 600 railway employees on back dates in just two months before an amount of Tk 70 lakh was seized from a microbus of the former railway minister's aide Omar Faruq Talukder.

RECRUITMENT IN WEST ZONE

A total of 443 people were recruited in the railway's west zone in a year from August 2010 to August last year.

Rickshaws ply VIP roads thru' bribery
"> Rickshaws plying on Abdul Gani Road near the Bangladesh Secretariat in the capital on Tuesday in violation of traffic rules.

Mirpur Road, Panthapath, Manik Mian Avenue, Phoenix Road, Ittefaq crossing to Bangabhaban, Hatirjheel, and Gulshan link road tell the same story.

Asked, Mir Rezaul Alam, joint commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (traffic), said the law enforcers would take action against the traffic police personnel if anyone was found taking bribes and showing negligence in discharging duties.

SM Salehuddin, former executive director of Dhaka Transport Coordination Board, has a different observation.

Ashikur Rahman, superintending engineer of Traffic Engineering Division of Dhaka South City Corporation, said the movement of two or three rickshaws were enough to disturb traffic management.

But only around 79,000 rickshaws and 7,793 rickshaw vans have permission to ply the streets of Dhaka.

Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), the banned militant outfit, issued a statement around two months back announcing Salauddin Ahmed alias Salehin as its ameer, said Monirul Islam, counterterrorism chief of DMP, yesterday.

The disclosure comes months after a JMB offshoot, �Neo JMB� as law enforcers call it, reportedly carried out two deadly terror attacks in Gulshan and Sholakia.

On February 23, 2014, Salehin and two other top militants -- Rakib Hasan Russell alias Hafez Mahmud and Jahidul Islam alias "Boma" Mizan -- were snatched away in a prison van ambush by militants in Trishal upazila of Mymensingh.

Salehin, who law enforcers believe used to shuttle between India and Bangladesh, narrowly escaped arrest when Kolkata police in a drive at a JMB hideout at bordering Bangaon in West Bengal arrested Trishal attack mastermind Anwar Hossain Faruq on September 25 this year.

Salehin, sentenced to death over the killing of a Christian youth in Jamalpur, was Sylhet-Mymensingh regional chief of JMB.

Law enforcers believe �Boma� Mizan, an explosives expert, is also hiding in India.

Hafez Mahmud, Khulna divisional commander of JMB and condemned to death, has been killed in an operation.

He referred to a recent robbery in Narsingdi following which four suspected JMB men were caught.

Asked about the strength of the mainstream JMB, Monirul Islam said the banned group still has a good number of activists in Jamalpur, Mymensingh, Tangail and North Bengal region -- the areas known to be JMB strongholds.

It, however, grabbed the limelight in April 2004 when it started vigilante operations against the ultra-left outlaws, popularly known as Sarbaharas, in Rajshahi, Natore, Naogaon and Bogra.

Investigators say the �Neo JMB�, which is inspired by IS ideologies, was responsible for the July 1 Gulshan caf� siege in which 20 hostages, including 17 foreigners, were killed.

Bribe for everything
Recruitment, transfer and promotion in public health sector involve bribes up to Tk 10 lakh in each case, says a new report released by the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) yesterday.

Because of such irregularities, people are losing confidence in healthcare in Bangladesh, he added.

Doctors sometimes use designations not recognised by the regulatory authority -- Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council -- only to cheat the patients.

THE Canadian company Niko became news in Bangladeshi media once again when an international tribunal rejected its challenge over the Bangladesh government's claim regarding payment of $106 million in compensation for two blowouts at Tengratila Gas Field in Chhatak.

The government filed a damage suit with a Dhaka court in June 2008 against Niko Resources Bangladesh Limited, claiming Tk.746.5 crore ($106 million) in recompense for the destruction of properties and gas reserves in and around the gas field

Before the tribunal, Niko challenged the case and another issue related to payment for gas sales from the Feni gas field, which the Canadian company operates with Bapex.

The first blowout was on January 7, 2005, in Tengratila of Sunamganj.

In the meantime, according to a 'sealed' affidavit filed in Alberta court by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) obtained by Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail through a legal battle, Niko appointed Canada's financially tainted Senator Mac Harb.

He came to Bangladesh at least four times between 2004 and 2006 to help Niko navigate the fallout from the explosion.

The senator was repeatedly warned by Canadian authorities to stop his lobbying, RCMP's affidavit shows.

On one of Harb's trips to Dhaka, the then Canadian high commissioner to Bangladesh was so incensed that she confronted the senator in his hotel.

In an interview with RCMP, she said that she was �not happy� that Harb �had actually met with the [Bangladeshi] minister of foreign affairs at his home, at night without me, and without me being aware of the meeting.�

In June, 2011, lawyers for Niko stood before an Alberta Court of Queen's Bench judge and, on behalf of the company, pleaded guilty to bribing the then Bangladesh state minister for energy and mineral resources, contrary to section 3(1)(b)of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPFA).

On June 23, 2011, Justice Scott Brooker of Alberta Queen's Bench delivered the verdict saying: �It is an embarrassment to all Canadians.� The court handed down a $9.5 million negotiated penalty against Niko, the maiden enforcement under the CFPOA, enacted in 1998.

In the detailed verdict, the reports of Dhaka's The Daily Star was referenced twice by the honourable judge.

The evidence was sufficient for the RCMP to state in the same court filing that it had �uncovered information that [Niko] used bribes to influence [Bangladeshi] public officials in order to secure the Joint Venture Agreement.� So why didn't the RCMP pursue the other charges?

Then there's the logistics of getting Bangladeshi witnesses before a Canadian court.

But eventually you've got to draw a line in the sand.�

The above could be issues for the Canadian RCMP, but they are non-issues for the Bangladesh ACC.

Why was the guilty plea of the bribery that was punished in the Canadian court not pursued in the Bangladeshi court to punish the bribed?

During their trip to Dhaka, the RCMP discussed the anti-bribery law, and what good it might do in the world.

This was good for Bangladesh,� RCMP investigator said.

The writer is the Convenor of the Canadian Committee for Human Rights and Democracy in Bangladesh.

Taking the case into cognizance, the court directed Anti-Corruption Commission�s Noakhali office to investigate into the matter.

Last reported, Assistant Director Moshiur Rahman of ACC Noakhali office said they are yet to receive the order.

Mosharraf sued over Niko bribery




The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday sued former state minister for energy A K M Mosharraf Hossain on charge of taking bribe from Niko, a Canadian oil and gas exploration company in Bangladesh.

ACC Assistant Director Shahidur Rahman filed the case with Shahbagh Police Station accusing Mosharraf Hossain and Kashem Sharif, the then vice-president of Niko Resources Ltd.

According to the case statement, Mosharraf took a Land Cruiser Jeep worth about Tk 95.58 lakh as a gift, and 5,000 Canadian dollars as bribe from Niko in 2005 in a bid to strike a contract between the government and Niko.

Under the arrangement, the government would buy gas extracted from the Feni Gas Field by Niko at an inflated price.

Earlier, Niko authorities confessed to a Canadian court that they were compelled to give the gift and bribe to sign the deal, it said.

Bribery rampant in land offices
Massive corruption prevails in the land offices and people have to pay bribes starting from Tk 100 to Tk 20 lakh in every step to get land related services, according a report of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) reveals.

The report by Berlin-based Transparency International surveyed more than 20,000 people in 16 countries spanning the Asia Pacific region from Pakistan to Australia.

Bribery rates were highest in India and Vietnam, where nearly two thirds of respondents said they had to sweeten the deal to access basic services like public education and healthcare.

Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia reported the lowest incidences of bribery.

Yet while poorer people were more likely to be targeted in countries like Thailand, India and Pakistan, the reverse trend was found in places like Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia.

When it came to perceptions of corruption Malaysia and Vietnam got the worst ratings from their citizens, who felt graft was widespread and accused their governments of doing little to fight it.

South Korea's President Park Geun-hye was impeached by parliament in December over a major influence-peddling scandal that prompted millions to take to the street for months to call for her resignation.

Malaysia has also been seized by a graft scandal since 2015, with global investigators accusing Premier Najib Razak and his associates of misappropriating billions of dollars through the state-backed 1MDB fund.

A report last year by a corruption watchdog also detailed the enormous wealth accumulated by the family and friends of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.

China, meanwhile, has been on anti-corruption drive that has netted more than one million officials, while fellow communist country Vietnam has also jailed a number of former businessmen for graft in its bloated state-run sector.

Thailand's junta government has vowed a similar anti-corruption campaign but there have been few convictions so far.

ACC will now investigate only corruption and bribery related cases, Cabinet Secretary M Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan told reporters after the cabinet meeting at Bangladesh Secretariat.

Besides, it was proposed to strengthen the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) as it will have the operational autonomy or functional independence under the Bangladesh Bank.

The central bank created the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit in 2012 to deal with financial crimes including money laundering.

The Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) hailed the cabinet decision, saying the proposed amendments would have positive impacts in fighting money laundering.

Referring to the huge deposits to the Swiss banks by Bangladeshis, he said money laundering was a sophisticated crime and its incidence was increasing in the country.

Samsung heir indicted for bribery
The heir to the Samsung empire and four other top executives were indicted yesterday on multiple charges including bribery and embezzlement, South Korean prosecutors said in the latest blow to the world's biggest smartphone maker.

The presentation of formal charges against Lee Jae-Yong and his colleagues makes them almost certain to face trial, casting new uncertainty over South Korea's biggest business group as it seeks to recover from a humiliating recall.

The PR disaster is partly blamed on the group's top-down management style, in which each Samsung unit simply follows orders from the elite Future Strategy Office without question.

It is also accused of separately giving millions of euros to Choi to bankroll her daughter's equestrian training in Germany.

NIKO signed bribery deals

The company, having been floated only in 1987, was so desperate that it did not even hesitate to appoint a consultancy firm, owned by a Bangladeshi-born American, for $4 million to handle the dirty work in Bangladesh, according to evidence obtained by The Daily Star.

Bangladesh, which has been drawn into legal battles at domestic and international courts, submitted the evidence only last year to the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Dispute (ICSID), where Niko filed two cases against the Bangladeshi energy custodian Petrobangla and Bapex in efforts to shrug off its responsibility.

Niko's corruption evidence seen by this newspaper include the firm's own admission to bribe the then state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain to further its business activities in Bangladesh; a cheque showing payment to Giasuddin Al Mamoon, a close friend and business partner of Tarique Rahman; payments to businessman Selim Bhuiyan who had close links with state minister Mosharraf; confessional statements of Selim Bhuiyan; and consultancy and management deals signed between Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd and Stratum.

April 1 & June 16, 2010: Niko Resources Bangladesh Ltd files two cases with ICSID



June 2011: Niko Canada pleads guilty before a Canadian court to bribe Mosharraf and agrees to pay a $9.5 million fine

The Niko case issue has come to the fore as the ICSID of the WB is set to hold the final hearing on April 24-29 of the two cases Niko filed against Bapex and Petrobangla.

Niko Resources (Bangladesh) filed the lawsuits in 2010 -- one seeking an order clearing it from the liability for the two blowouts in Tengratila in 2005 and the other demanding outstanding payments for the gas it supplied from the Feni gas field to Petrobangla.

After the BNP-led alliance government took office in 2001, Niko signed the controversial joint venture agreement (JVA) with Bapex to develop two "marginal" gas fields in Chhatak and Feni in 2003.

However, Niko later developed a small used gas field in Feni and started selling gas to Petrobangla.

But Niko's first venture to explore a virgin (new or unexplored) gas field in Tengratila of Chhatak led to two blowouts in January and May 2005, causing damage to properties and the environment.

The blowouts and the subsequent payments in bribe to settle the issue drew the Canadian company into controversy.

THE CORRUPTION TRAIL

It all goes back to 1997, when Niko entered Bangladesh during the second round Production Sharing Contract bidding for oil and gas exploration.

In 1998, it submitted an unsolicited proposal for developing the Chhatak and Feni gas fields.

But Bapex refused to sign the deal as it found Chhatak field was a virgin (unexplored) field, and not a used one as Niko falsely claimed.

Under the agreement, the Switzerland-based consultancy firm with office in Dhaka would "act on behalf of Niko, to facilitate the approval process in relation to the JVA�.

Stratum was headed by Qasim Sharif, who was well known to an influential secretary of the then AL government, worked as an agent for Niko's Bangladesh subsidiary.

After the signing of the JVA in October 2003, he became president of Niko's Bangladesh chapter.

He now lives in the US.

According to the 2003 contact, "Stratum shall invoice Niko Bangladesh for a retainer fee in the Sum of $20,000 per month effective October 1, 2003.

This fee shall cover Stratum's fee in addition to all costs and expenses made or incurred by Stratum such as payments made to expedite or secure the performance by a foreign [Bangladesh] public official of any act of a routine nature that is part of the foreign public official's duties or functions, such as the issuance of permits or licenses required for the [Niko's] Project, the processing of official documents, visas or work permits and the like."

PARTNERS IN CRIME

Government documents show that the JVA deal, signed on October 16, 2003, was vetted by the law ministry and approved by the then prime minister Khaleda Zia.

Giving the legal opinion in favour of the unsolicited deal, the law ministry said, "The Swiss Challenge method is not applicable for the proposed marginalised gas fields".

In an interview with Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Qasim on December 16, 2010, admitted that Niko did pay Moudud the sum, but it was for the job he did before becoming minister.

Five days after the JVA was signed, Niko wire-transferred $2.93 million from Niko Canada's First Caribbean International Bank (Barbados) account to a Union Bancaire Privee (Zurich) Swiss bank account of Stratum.

From the sum, Qasim paid $500,000 (around Tk 3 crore) to another company called Nationwide, owned by Selim Bhuiyan, former president of Dhaka Club, who also worked as a Niko agent.

Four years later, Selim admitted before a Dhaka court that he took the money and paid Mamoon.

Mohammad Waliul Islam, a Metropolitan Magistrate of Dhaka, recorded his confessional statement on January 15, 2008.

After the signing of the JVA, Qasim, as he had promised, deposited $500,000 (Tk 3 crore) into Selim's Standard Chartered Bank account in Gulshan branch in phases.

"Mr Mamoon told me that he was taking the lion's share of the money as Tarique Rahman was with him," Selim, who now lives in Dhaka, said in the confessional statement.

He also denied taking money from Niko, but admitted to have travelled to Canada with Mosharraf.

When the RCMP officials -- Corporal Kevin Duggan and Corporal Lloyd Schoepp -- asked Mamoon about the source of his influence, he said: "My power is fifty percent, I'm the friend of Tarique Rahman.�

MORE BRIBE FOR DAMAGE CONTROL

The first blowout at the Chhatak field in Sunamganj took place on January 8, 2005, just a few days after Niko started drilling.

The gas field burned for years, causing a loss of $1.05 billion to Bangladesh.

Alerted by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the RCMP launched an investigation in June 2005.

In June 2011, Niko Canada pleaded guilty before a Canadian court to bribing Mosharraf with the luxury SUV and a trip to New York and Calgary.

The company also agreed to pay $9.5 million in fine, which went to the Canadian government fund.

The Alberta Court of Queen's bench in its verdict said, "The fine reflects that Niko Canada made these payments in order to persuade the Bangladeshi energy minister to exercise his influence to ensure that Niko was able to secure a gas purchase and sales agreement acceptable to Niko, as well as to ensure the company was dealt with fairly in relation to claims for compensation for the blowouts, which represented potentially very large amounts of money."

Although the gas purchase and supply agreement (GPSA) was signed in December 2006, Mosharraf allegedly forced Petrobangla to start buying gas from the Feni field from November 2004 when the gas price was yet to be fixed.

SERIES OF CASES

Over the years, nearly a dozen cases have been filed against high-profile people in local and international courts over the graft scandal, making it a much-talked about issue in Bangladesh.

Niko faced the first legal challenges after the blowouts in 2005, when 10 organisations, including Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, filed a writ petition challenging the validity of the JVA.

In its order, the High Court asked the government not to pay Niko any money until it pays compensation for the blowouts.

Earlier in 2008, the caretaker government filed a damage suit with a Dhaka court against Niko, claiming Tk 746.5 crore in compensation for the destruction of properties and gas reserves in and around the Chhatak gas field.

In September 2014, the tribunal gave its first decision in favour of Niko in the case over the outstanding payments, with insiders alleging Bangladesh's legal battle was timid.

After that procedural order, Bapex and Petrobangla changed their counsel and appointed a law firm, Foley Hoag of Washington DC, in July 2015.

A Bapex official said Niko stopped operation in Chhatak and Feni gas fields following the blowouts and the subsequent lawsuits.

It, however, is working in partnership with a gas company in a gas field in Comilla.

Asked about the evidence against him, AKM Mosharraf yesterday flatly denied it all: He did not take any car from Niko nor did he travel to the US and Canada with Niko's money.

ISIS threats in Bangladesh - Denials and Delusions
It has happened again!

In the wake of the latest round of terror attacks in Bangladesh, with ISIS claiming credit for it, authorities in the country have again started resorting to the old response.

Rejecting any ISIS involvement in terror attacks in Bangladesh as �propaganda�, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Kamal poses the question: �Why will the ISIS come here?� One wonders if leaders in any terror-infested country would ever ask a similar question!

It's noteworthy that politicians and law-enforcers in Bangladesh either cry wolf about �impending terror attacks� in the country or they cry hoarse denying the existence of any international terrorist group.

After the well-publicised July attack at the Holey Artisan in Dhaka, which killed 29 people � including the five gunmen � the Government flatly denied any ISIS involvement in the attack.



On March 24, another suicide bomber attacked a police box and blew himself up in Uttara, near Dhaka Airport.

On the same day, the army, police, and RAB began an operation at a suspected den of banned Islamist militant Jama'atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh (JMB) at a house in Shibbari area of Sylhet city in northeastern Bangladesh.

By March 26, six people, including two policemen, were killed in terrorist bomb blasts and grenade attacks in Sylhet; and later two terrorists blew themselves up.

Since the police are mainly trained to maintain law and order, and prevent crime; and the military to defend the country from internal and external enemies, they have very limited understanding and role in counterterrorism (CT) operations.

Law-enforcers can neither be the main CT operators, nor can they decide whether particular genres of terrorists are homegrown, or in cahoots with transnational terror groups like al Qaeda and ISIS.

The Inspector General of Police (IGP) AKM Shahidul Haque believes any claim about ISIS presence in Bangladesh is �baseless propaganda�.



However, we know security analysts and academics can be CT and COIN (counterinsurgency) experts as well; and at times, they know as much if not more about terrorism and insurgency as the brightest police or military officer.

There is enough evidence to conclude that the JMB is in league with the so-called Islamic State, which is a transnational terrorist group, mainly based in war-torn Syria and Iraq.

Khalid Masood, the 52-year-old British terrorist who on March 22 killed several people in London and was killed by police, is widely believed to be an ISIS recruit.



BNP's State Minister for Home Lutfozzaman Babar rejected the presence of any Islamist terror group in Bangladesh soon after the JMB had detonated 500 bombs at 300 locations in Bangladesh in 2005.

Of late, various sources have revealed the strength of the JMB, which by 2007 had more than 10,000 members across Bangladesh [Adam Stahl, �Challenges Facing Bangladesh�, International Institute for Counter-Terrorism].

The JMB is also closely linked with the ISIS; its support is there and, according to a Bangladeshi intelligence report, is also capable of making improvised explosive device (IED) as has been seen in Sylhet and elsewhere.

Unaccountable governance, corruption, and massive youth unemployment � around 40 percent of Bangladeshi youths don't have any regular employment � lead to social unrest, which is the mother of terrorism.

In sum, living with terrorism is the "new normal" globally and Bangladesh will have to live with this reality.

While some Bangladeshi youths, including girls, have joined the ISIS in Syria and Iraq � on March 16 one Neaz Morshed Raja of Bangladesh died as a suicide bomber in Tikrit, Iraq � denying any ISIS threat in Bangladesh is denial of the truth that is proving increasingly expensive.

Framed Bangladesh Bank official recalls 'cop brutality'
What does a commoner do when a policeman, who is oath-bound to provide security to people, points his gun at him to squeeze money out of his pocket?

�Bribe taking�: 2 UGC officials sent to forced leave
The University Grants Commission (UGC) today sent two of its officials on forced leave after a written complaint from Khulna University (KU) vice-chancellor stating that they demanded a bribe of Tk 10 lakh from him, says a press release.

That is stupid," Infantino told the Le Matin Dimanche weekly, referring to reports that he has clinched an annual salary of two million Swiss francs ($2 million, 1.8 million euros).

Infantino, who took the helm of the scandal-plagued body in February vowing to lead world football into a new era of "transparency" and "honesty" also addressed claims by Germany's Die Welt newspaper Friday that he had improperly ordered the destruction of the minutes of a FIFA executive committee meeting held at last month's congress in Mexico City, in which his salary was discussed

The paper alleged FIFA's independent ethics committee was looking at the issue and could impose a 90-day ban on the new president if the allegation was confirmed, but the ethics committee denied that any investigation was ongoing.

He would not comment on whether a search carried out by Swiss authorities at the FIFA headquarters on Thursday was linked to the FIFA investigation findings, beyond stressing that "it was not my office or that of the new Secretary General that was searched, but Kattner's office."

Blatter is already serving a six-year suspension from football over a two million Swiss franc ($2 million, 1.8 million euros) payment to former FIFA vice president Michel Platini.

IS claims blast killing four at Saudi mosque
Islamic State claimed responsibility for a bombing that killed four people at a Shi'ite Muslim mosque in eastern Saudi Arabia on Friday, the second attack claimed by the Sunni militant group in a week in the world's top oil-exporting country.

Sectarian Confrontation

Islamic State openly acknowledges it is trying to stir sectarian confrontation as a way of hastening the overthrow of the ruling Al Saud family, and has urged young Saudi Sunnis in the kingdom to attack targets including Shi'ites.

Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, emir of neighboring Kuwait, said on Wednesday sectarian strife was the most serious threat facing Muslims and called for immediate action to tackle it.

Some commentators in Saudi Arabia discussing the Qadeeh bombing have said the kingdom has not done enough to crack down on online abuse of Shi'ites, a discourse which Shi'ites say provides an incubator for violence against the minority sect.

Sunni power Saudi and Shi'ite Iran are locked in a tussle for influence in the region, where wars have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives mainly in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

They identified one of the victims as Abdel-Jalil Taher al-Arbash and said he had recently returned from studying in the United States.

US bombing of hospital in Kunduz
Nothing can explain away the bombing of the hospital being run by the Doctors Without Borders in Kunduz on October 3.

Reportedly, this is one of the most horrible and noticeable cases of civilian deaths inflicted by US forces in the 14-year war in Afghanistan � a war that was declared all but over by the US president.

It is surprising that in spite of the fact that all the parties involved in the conflict in Afghanistan had foreknowledge about the location of the hospital it was targeted by the US air force.

The current incident brings into greater relief the issue of civilian deaths in such circumstances which have so far been passed off as collateral damage not only in Afghanistan but also in countries and regions where conflicts are raging.

In Afghanistan alone,14,000 civilians have been killed, good many of them by the US forces.

Bomber still not identified
Three days have gone by since a suicide attack in an Ahmadiyya mosque in Sayedpur Chalkpara of Rajshahi but police still do not know who the bomber was.

The bomber set off the explosive belt he was wearing inside the mosque of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat of Bagmara upazila on Christmas Day.

Inspector Abul Kalam Azad of Bagmara Police Station, the investigation officer of the case, said they were busy listing the evidence, taking court orders for sending the evidence to respective departments for tests, sending those, and burial of the body.

The bomber before the attack told the mosque's muezzin Shaheb Ali Talukhdar that he studied at Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and that he hailed from Mohonpur upazila of Rajshahi.

The body of the bomber was buried yesterday at Hatimkhan graveyard in Rajshahi by Quantum Foundation after police handed the body over to them.

Central Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat leaders yesterday termed the Bagmara blast an international conspiracy and directed Ahmadiyyas to find the attackers.

Mobasserur Rahman, national amir of the Jamaat, and national muballig Abdul Awal Khan Chowdhury from Dhaka went to the village yesterday afternoon and talked to the Ahmadiyyas there.

Meanwhile, security has been beefed up at Chandtara village of Ghatail upazila in Tangail where around 30 Ahmadiyya families live, our Tangail correspondent reports quoting local police.

30 killed in Somalia bombings claimed by Islamists
At least 30 people have been killed in twin bomb attacks claimed by Shebab Islamists at a busy restaurant in the Somali city of Baidoa, the regional governor said Monday.

The regional administration in Baidoa is protected by troops of the 22,000-strong African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is supporting the internationally-backed government of Somalia.

The African Union's top official for Somalia, Francisco Caetano Madeira, condemned Sunday's attack.

Forced out of Mogadishu in mid-2011, the Shebab are on a mission to disprove suggestions they are close to defeat and have claimed several spectacular attacks in recent months, both in Somalia and in neighbouring Kenya.

On Sunday leaders and officials from the countries contributing troops to AMISOM met in Djibouti for a summit after the European Union announced plans to reduce its funding of the force by 20 percent.

Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta said AMISOM need more international support to defeat the Shebab and strengthen Somalia's weak government and regional security.

"Whereas the continent is footing the bill of stabilising Somalia by blood and flesh, it is disheartening that the international community is even contemplating to reduce support to AMISOM," Kenyatta said.

IS blasts in Syria kill at least 140
Bomb blasts killed scores of people in Jableh and Tartous on Syria's Mediterranean coast today and wounded many others in the government-controlled territory that hosts Russian military bases, monitors and state media said.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 145 people were killed in attacks by at least five suicide bombers and two devices planted in cars.

The attacks were the first of their kind in Tartous, capital of Tartous province and home to a Russian naval facility, and Jableh in Latakia province, near a Russian-operated air base.

"This demonstrates yet again just how fragile the situation in Syria is.

Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his readiness to fight with the Syrian government against "the terrorist threat" sent his condolences to Assad, the Kremlin said.

The Syrian foreign ministry sent a letter to the United Nations, state television reported, saying the blasts were a "dangerous escalation by the hostile and extremist regimes in Riyadh, Ankara and Doha", referring to support given to the rebels by Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar.

Syria's Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said in an interview with Ikhbariya that terrorists were resorting to bomb attacks against civilians instead of fighting on the front lines, and vowed to keep battling them.

France's foreign ministry called the Tartous and Jableh bombings "odious", and said violence from all sides must stop if a political transition is to take place.

Smuggling, human trafficking create border problems
Director General of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) Maj Gen Rakibul Islam yesterday said cross border smuggling and human trafficking are the key issues that sometimes create problem in the border areas of Bangladesh and India.

"Borders of the two countries generally remain calm, but smugglers of drugs and other goods and human traffickers, who are always active across the borders, often create problem" he said at a press briefing after an informal meeting with BSF officials at zero line of India-Bangladesh border at Hili of Hakimpur upazila in Dinajpur.

Thanking BDR and BSF for their efforts to maintain peace in the border area of Bangladesh and India, he said, "We wear different uniforms, but we are human being and it is our duty to save our motherland from any culprits."

He expressed hope that his visit to India through the border of Hili land port will help to strengthen brotherhood between the two countries.

9 'militants' held while �preparing for bank robbery�
Detectives claimed to have arrested nine members of banned militant outfits Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji) and Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) while preparing for a bank robbery in Dhaka.

A huge amount of bombs, explosives and books on jihad were also seized from their possession, a text message sent by Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) said.

Bangladesh Jihadi Group, militants of banned outfits Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji) and Ansarullah Bangla Team were on the prowl to raise fund and establish a umbrella network.

Detectives today came up with such claims at a press briefing at Dhaka Metropolitan Police media centre following arrest of nine suspected Huji and ABT men.

They were nabbed from the capital�s Banashree and Sutrapur on Sunday, DMP Joint Commissioner (crime) Krishna Pada Roy told the press briefing.

Three others were arrested from Sutrapur that evening.

The group had a plan to rob a bank in Dinajpur as well, Sanwar added.

Later around 7:30 that evening, the same team detained Mawlana Nurullah Kashemi, 58, Delwar Hossain, 55, and Yasin Arafat, 28, from a Delwar�s house on Lalmohan Das Lane at Sutrapur.

Kashemi is a spiritual leader and also a preacher while Delwar, who would host the group at the old part of Dhaka, is a local businessman.

Four cases were filed against them with Khilgaon and Sutrapur police.

8 Turkish troops killed in bomb attack
Eight Turkish soldiers have been killed in a bomb attack in the south-eastern province of Siirt, the army says.

One policeman was slightly injured in the attack and a third suspect is being sought, the Turkish Anadolu news agency reported.

A statement from the Istanbul governor's office said the attackers were from a "terrorist group" and that they had previously carried out an attack on the Istanbul HQ of the ruling AK party on 8 August.

The founder of modern Turkey, Mustapha Kemal Ataturk, died there in 1938, and the palace is now a major tourist attraction.

Turkey has been on high alert since launching a two-pronged air campaign against the Islamic State group in Syria and PKK bases in northern Iraq last month.

How Stade de France tragedy unfolded
What is there to say?

In the 17th minute of the friendly between France and Germany there came a first explosion that shook the Stade de France during the Paris attacks.

Little by little, everyone in the Stade de France started to understand the gravity of the situation.

No announcement was made, the football continued to be played and the stadium exploded with joy when France scored each of their goals.

The atmosphere was frozen.�



Yet there was still no sign of the problems coming from outside the Stade de France, so as not to alarm the 70,000 fans.

When the final whistle was blown by the Spanish referee, the PA system announced: �There have been incidents outside the stadium, please leave by the west gates.�



Just as at the end of every game, I went in the direction of the press conferences.

The French FA were categorical: there was to be neither press conference nor a mixed zone.

The match between France and England is liable to be cancelled... football cannot live in these conditions

France retaliates, bombs Syria after Paris carnage
French warplanes pounded the Islamic State group's de facto capital in Syria on Sunday, in the first such strikes since a wave of coordinated attacks claimed by the jihadists left 129 people dead in Paris.

As the nation prepared to mourn the victims of the carnage in a minute of silence on Monday, a dozen warplanes dropped 20 bombs on IS targets in the Islamists' stronghold of Raqa, signalling the French government's resolve in its fight against the group.

As the probe into the assault spread across Europe, French police released a photograph of a "dangerous" suspect wanted over the attacks.

The suspect, 26-year-old Salah Abdeslam said to be one of three brothers linked to the attacks, is also wanted by Belgium, which has issued an international arrest warrant for him.

.

Security sources said the wanted man's brother, 31-year-old Brahim Abdeslam, blew himself up outside a cafe on Boulevard Voltaire in eastern Paris, while the third brother is believed to be among seven people detained in Belgium.

Six other gunmen wearing suicide belts died during the attacks in the French capital -- three at the Stade de France stadium and three at the Bataclan concert hall, the scene of the worst bloodshed.

The sports minister said at least one of the bombers who detonated their explosives near the stadium had tried to enter the venue where France were playing Germany in an international football match at the time.

As night fell over the jittery French capital on Sunday, crowds shocked by the brutality of the killings packed into the Notre-Dame cathedral to mourn the dead.

.

In a further sign of the growing Belgian connection to the attacks, investigators said two cars used in the violence were hired in Belgium.

PARIS IN MOURNING

Paris residents struggled to come to terms with the latest atrocities, 10 months after jihadists hit satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket.

The Islamic State group said they carried out the attacks in revenge for French air strikes in Syria and threatened further violence in France "as long as it continues its Crusader campaign".

World leaders united Sunday to denounce terrorism at a heavily-guarded G20 summit in Turkey and observed a minute's silence in respect of those who were killed.

"We stand in solidarity with France in hunting down the perpetrators of this crime and bringing them to justice," US President Barack Obama said after talks with his host, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

.

On January 14 last year, Liton started for Magura with his truck loaded with stones from Chapainawabganj under law enforcers' protection.

Even so, as his vehicle reached Shibganj Bazar in the evening, a youth came out of a roadside house and hurled a crude bomb right at his face.

.

Treated in Chennai in India thrice, the vision in his right eye has improved a little.

The day labourer from Chakaria of Cox's Bazar sold a small piece of land, mortgaged his homestead and borrowed some money from relatives to go to Qatar.

Taher along with two other men from Chakaria was on his way to Dhaka to catch a flight to Qatar.

When he died, many people, including the local MP, police and journalists, came.

In total, eight people were killed in this attack on an Icon Paribahan bus that was coming to Dhaka from Cox's Bazar.

Suspected blockaders firebombed the bus at Chouddagram in Comilla.

The families of Rashedul and Yusuf, the two other victims from Chakaria, had also mortgaged their homesteads to pay for their trip to Qatar.

Why then he was killed this way?�

Yusuf, Taher's neighbour, initially did not want to go to Qatar.

"I hoped that once my father is in Qatar, he will take my husband there.

Six killed by bomb at Turkey police HQ
A car bomb blast has hit a police headquarters in south-eastern Turkey, killing six people and wounding at least 39, officials say.

Another police station, in Midyat town, in neighbouring Mardin province, was also attacked by militants, according to Turkish media, but there are no reports of casualties.

Diyarbakir province has seen violent clashes between PKK separatists and the Turkish army in recent months.

A ceasefire between the army and the PKK collapsed in July, and Turkish jets have since bombed PKK bases in northern Iraq and the army launched a ground operation there.

Turkey is also part of a US-led coalition that has been carrying out air strikes against Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq and Syria.

Mahmudur won't be freed now
Mahmudur Rahman, acting editor of Bangla daily Amar Desh, was shown arrested in a bomb blast case yesterday, a day after the Supreme Court upheld a High Court bail granted to him in a sedition case.

Sub-inspector Harun-Or-Rashid of Shahbagh Police Station, also the investigating officer of the case, submitted the petition to the court.

The case was filed on January 28, 2013 with Shahbagh Police Station against 44 leaders and activists of the BNP-led 20-party alliance for their alleged involvement in blasting crude bombs in front of the Dhaka University central playground.

SEDITION CASE

Sahidur Rahman, a prosecutor of the International Crimes Tribunal-1, filed the sedition case against Mahmudur with Tejgaon Police Station on December 13, 2012, under the Information and Communication Technology Act, 2006.

In the case, the acting editor was charged with sedition for publishing alleged Skype conversations between Justice Md Nizamul Huq, then chairman of ICT-1, and Ahmed Ziauddin, an expatriate Bangladeshi legal expert.

Cops bust 'militants' den', recover arms, explosives
Police yesterday recovered 20 grenades, firearms and ammunition, and a huge amount of bomb-making materials, including gel explosives, from a house in Sherpur upazila of Bogra where two people were killed in a bomb explosion Sunday night.

�The evidence we have collected suggest that the house was being used as a JMB den and militants were planning to carry out subversive activities,� Md Asaduzzaman, superintendent of police in Bogra, told The Daily Star.

Owner of the house Mahbubur Rahman, who lives in Dhaka, rented out the house six months ago to one Mizanur Rahman who introduced himself as a CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver from Naogaon.

Locals said Mizanur, his wife and daughter left for Naogaon on Friday.

Contacted, Monirul Islam, chief of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit, said the house was the den of a JMB faction, which had also used a flat in the capital's Mirpur as their den.

On December 24 last year, detectives in a 15-hour raid at the Mirpur house seized 16 improvised grenades, other ingredients, including gel explosives enough to make over 200 bombs and grenades, and a suicide vest.

France extends state of emergency to cover Euros
France's parliament confirmed Thursday a two-month extension of the state of emergency that has been in place since November's jihadist attacks to cover the Euro 2016 football tournament and Tour de France.

"The terrorist threat remains at a high level and France, like the EU, is a target," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve ahead of the vote.

Millions of spectators are also expected for the Tour de France cycling race, which is set for July 2-24 and this year covers a route of 3,519 kilometres (2,247 miles).

The state of emergency was imposed following the November 13 attacks that left 130 people dead in the French capital, and was already extended by three months in February until May 26.

The French Human Rights League (LDH) has criticised the extension, saying the government was becoming "hooked on the state of emergency".

EgyptAir jet lands in Uzbekistan after hoax bomb threat
An EgyptAir plane that was forced to land in Uzbekistan due to a hoax bomb threat has been cleared to resume its journey from Cairo to Beijing.

The aircraft was searched by Uzbek security forces but no explosive device was found, Egyptian officials said.

The cause of the crash remains a mystery, although Egyptian officials have said an act of terrorism is more likely than a technical failure.

French investigators said last week that signals from one of the plane's black boxes had been detected about 290km (180 miles north) of the Egyptian coast.

The plane eventually touched down at Urgench, about 840km (600 miles) west of the Uzbek capital Tashkent, at 03:00 GMT (08:00 Tashkent time) on Wednesday, Uzbekistan Airways said in a statement.

Egyptian officials told the Associated Press news agency that the plane resumed its journey to Beijing about four hours after landing in Urgench.

The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, also said the bomb threat was a hoax.

Bombs outside Istanbul soccer stadium kill 29
-Blasts came two hours after end of soccer match

-Explosions were less than a minute apart

-Most of those killed were police officers

-Ten detained, no claim of responsibility

Two bombs exploded less than a minute apart, killing 29 people and wounding 166 outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul on Saturday night, in a co-ordinated attack on police shortly after a match between two of Turkey's top teams.

But the blasts came less than a week after Islamic State urged its supporters to target Turkey's "security, military, economic and media establishment".

Turkey is a member of the NATO military alliance and part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State.

It launched a military incursion into Syria in August against the radical Islamist group.

The United States condemned the attack and said it stood with its NATO ally.

The bombings come five months after Turkey was shaken by a failed military coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, many of them in Istanbul, as rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets in a bid to seize power.

Turkey mourns after twin Istanbul bombings kill 29
Turkey declared a day of national mourning on Sunday after twin bombings targeting police struck the heart of Istanbul near the home stadium of football giants Besiktas, killing 29 people.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim ordered flags to fly at half mast while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan postponed a planned trip to Kazakhstan, the state news agency Anadolu reported.

Twenty-seven of those killed were police and two were civilians, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said, adding that 10 suspects had been detained.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemned the "horrific acts of terror" in Istanbul, adding: "We stand united in solidarity with our ally Turkey.

The US embassy in Turkey wrote on Twitter: "Our hearts and prayers are with the people of #Istanbul tonight."

Turkey is still reeling from a failed July 15 coup blamed by the government on the US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen that has been followed by a relentless purge of his alleged supporters from state institutions.

Rooney suffers blackmail








The plot allegedly took place after the footballer's wife lost her camera phone at an arena in Manchester after attending a concert by US band Black Eyed Peas in May last year.

�They are blackmailing the government by saying if the government does not pay them the money and if the workers go for any unrest, the government would be responsible for that,� he said while speaking at the Bangladesh Sanglap hosted by BBC Bangla Service.

Adviser to Prime Minister Dr Syed Modasser Ali said, �Our garment industries were benefited by the economic recession in the US and elsewhere and it was making positive growth.�

�They [garment owners] need to recognise that how logical it would be that the government would pay the workers' Eid bonus owned by them.

President of Bangladesh Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industries Salima Ahmad said it is unfortunate that people always support the workers, not the owners.

Benzema held over blackmail


The Real Madrid and France star arrived with a hood pulled over his head at the police station in Versailles, near Paris, early on Wednesday and was placed in detention, the local prosecutor confirmed.

Investigators are trying determine the extent of Benzema's involvement in a months-long attempt to extort money from fellow French international Valbuena after a sextape found its way into the hands of a group of blackmailers.

According to the source, Benzema mentioned the intimate video to Valbuena when the French team met for training near Paris in early October, ahead of matches against Armenia and Denmark.

It is not the first time the French striker has been embroiled in a police investigation.

'Hair trying to blackmail ICC'
Australian cricket umpire Darrell Hair tried to "blackmail" the International Cricket Council (ICC) into paying him off through "sheer mudslinging", an employment tribunal heard on Wednesday.

ICC lawyer Michael Beloff accused Hair of trying to pressurize the body into paying him off by threatening to go public with allegations of racism, in the wake of a controversial decision against Pakistan at the Oval last year.

Hair was one of two umpires officiating in the fourth and final Test between England and Pakistan at The Oval who awarded England five penalty runs because they believed Pakistan had illegally tampered with the ball.

Pakistan were incensed by the decision and refused to return to the pitch after the tea interval.

The match was eventually awarded to England, who took the series 3-0.

Hair is suing the ICC for alleged racial discrimination because he says that, while he has not been allowed to officiate in Test matches since, his co-umpire Billy Doctrove, a West Indian, has escaped censure.

Beloff noted emails which Hair sent in the aftermath of the Oval test, in which first he offered to resign for a one-off payment of 500,000 US dollars (350,000 euros), then revised the offer after speculation about possible racism allegations.

Beloff also described as a "scurrilous smear" allegations by Hair that Pakistan Cricket Board head Nasim Ashraf had reputedly been involved in financial irregularities.

Say no to 'blackmail'
Greek PM Alexis Tsipras yesterday called on voters to reject "blackmail" when they vote in a bailout referendum tomorrow.

In a short TV address, he insisted Greece's presence in the EU was not at stake and urged voters to reject the "sirens of scaremongering".

Tomorrow, Greek voters will decide whether they support the terms of further international loans, following months of tough talks with creditors.

EU leaders have warned that a "No" vote could see Greece leave the eurozone.

Greece's economy is already being squeezed after the country lost access to fresh funds.

On top of that, Greece was officially declared in default yesterday, injecting even more urgency into a make-or-break weekend referendum that new polls suggested was too close to call.

The European Financial Stability Facility said, though, that it had decided to not immediately demand repayment of its loans -- a step that analysts say could have triggered sudden "Grexit", or Greece's exit from the eurozone.

The news will come as a fresh shock to Greece's 11 million people, and will hang over two major, rival rallies taking place in Athens late yesterday seeking to galvanise 'Yes' and 'No' support for the referendum.

There have also been forceful exchanges of views across the continent, with European politicians starkly denying Greek claims that a "No" vote will strengthen their hand in the bailout negotiations.

"If the Greeks will vote 'No' the Greek position will be dramatically weakened," said EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

And Jeroen Dijsselbloem - head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers - dismissed as "completely false" a claim by Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis that a deal would be reached very shortly after the referendum, allowing banks to reopen on Tuesday.

Several European officials have complained in strong terms about Greece's abrupt decision to hold a referendum on the terms of a bailout offer that they say is no longer on the table.

Greece's top court, the Council of State, is due to rule on the legality of Sunday's vote and whether it breaches the constitution.

Turkey warned against �blackmailing� EU
Europe must not let itself be blackmailed by Turkey in talks about visa-free travel for Turkish citizens in the EU, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has said.

Visa-free access to the EU is seen as a reward for Turkey's role in halting an influx of migrants into Europe.

But the move has been delayed because of a row over anti-terror legislation following Turkey's failed coup.

"It's up to Turkey whether there can be visa-travel or not," Gabriel said.

He said Turkey was drastically distancing itself from Europe by "moving towards reintroducing the death penalty" which was a "flagrant contravention of the EU's charter of fundamental rights".

He said the charter was "a vital part" of the EU and must be accepted and put into practice if Turkey wanted to remain be a part of the EU.

"It is up to Turkey to implement the standards and not to make them worse," he said.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said over the weekend that he might rescind his country's agreement with the EU to curb the flow of migrants if the bloc did not in return deliver visa-free travel for Turks.

Germany has urged Turkey to show "proportionality" over the issue - especially in its pursuit of those behind last month's coup.

"It is up to Turkey if there is or there isn't visa liberalisation," Gabriel said.

"Germany and Europe should under no circumstances be blackmailed."

The vice-chancellor also welcomed a decision to prevent Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan from addressing via video-link a rally in Cologne on Sunday.

The ban led to the Turkish foreign ministry summoning the German charges d'affaires.

Eoin escapes a blackmail attempt
England one-day captain Eoin Morgan was recently the target of a blackmail attempt by an Australian man, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) revealed in a statement on Thursday.

The ECB said it had received an email from the man demanding a "five-figure sum" to prevent him revealing details of a relationship that Morgan had with a woman five years ago to the British and Australian press.

Following discussions with British police, the ECB approached the man, who "admitted and apologised for his actions, blaming jealousy".

The pariah's nuclear blackmail
NONE would dispute the generally held belief that North Korea and Burma have the two most oppressive regimes in Asia.

No foreign leader of distinction cares to pay court to the ruling generals of Burma in their weirdly grandiose new capital of Naypidaw.

Clinton had gone there, of course, to secure the release of two American journalists who were apprehended on the China-North Korea border a few months ago and held hostage since then.

It is presumed that the North Koreans did so with the explicit purpose of forcing a high level American visit and hitting the news headlines.

The US did pay the Devil but with a private US citizen rather than his wife, the US secretary of state, making the visit to Kim Jong-il.

The Burmese regime is looked upon by most foreign governments as ugly but basically harmless except to its own people, but the North Korean regime is seen both as ugly and as extremely dangerous.

And the dangerous thing about North Korea is its nuclear weapons.

If the Burmese generals also want to have emissaries from great powers genuflecting at their doorstep they need some nuclear pieces in their arsenal, although a nuclear-armed Burma is indeed a ridiculous idea.

Burma has no external enemy that it needs to deter, let alone wants to attack.

But respect also matters for a regime like the one at Burma, otherwise it feels neglected and the regime's legitimacy is always put to the question.

According to the regime's estimate, a few Burmese nukes on a launching pad would elicit a whole lot of foreign attention as well as respect.

The articles published recently by Prof. Desmond Ball of ANU (an authority on strategic matters) in the Sydney Morning Herald and Bangkok Post pointed for the first time to the Burmese nuclear ambition, Ball's revelations suggest that the Burmese military regime has already sought North Korean help to build its own nuclear weapon.

It specifically wants the North Koreans to create a plutonium reprocessing plant in the caves near Laung Laing in Northern Burma -- not far from the site of a civilian nuclear reactor that is being built with Russian help.

So far, the story surrounding Burma's nuclear activity sounds like a fantasy.

But the usually reliable website "Dictator Watch" has been publishing warnings about Burmese nuclear weapon projects for several years now.

For example, a former army officer who was sent to Moscow for two years training in nuclear engineering never returned, and joined the ranks of informers on Burma's nuclear secrets.

The speculations, however, are about why North Korea would be in complicity with Burma to further proliferate nuclear technology.

One guess is that North Korea is being paid in "yellow cake" -- partially refined uranium which Burma is endowed with.

And North Korean help is also needed because of the fact that the country is willing to sell technology to anybody equally willing to pay.

There are several other pointers that North Korea is really helping Burma to develop its nuclear weapon -- Prof. Ball suggested that Burma could be processing 8 kg of plutonium per year by 2014, after which it could produce one atomic bomb per year.

But it is also know that apparently competent intelligence agencies like CIA and Mossad have been predicting that Iran would have nuclear weapons within five years -- practically every year since 1990.

They were wrong about Iran every year.

And Iran is a much more advanced country in scientific, technological and industrial terms, than Burma.

Supposing the prediction as regards Burma comes true, why would Burma be doing it?

Not to nuke Thailand, Malaysia or Bangladesh for it has no serious quarrel with these neighbours.

Because then the US and other great powers, instead of condemning and boycotting the Burmese dictatorship, would be begging it to be responsible and give up its nuclear weapons.

North Korea also developed nuclear weapon precisely for the same purpose.

Nukes defence against US blackmail: N Korea
North Korea yesterday sought to justify its weapons programme as a defence against US nuclear "blackmail" as world powers debated ways to punish Pyongyang for its fifth and most powerful atomic test.

The United States, Britain and France pushed the United Nations Security Council on Friday to impose new sanctions on North Korea over its fifth and biggest nuclear test as the 15-member council condemned the move by Pyongyang.

South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China all condemned the blast at the Punggye-ri nuclear site.

But the North's ruling party newspaper vowed yesterday not to submit to US nuclear "blackmail", and described the South's President Park Geun-Hye as a "dirty prostitute" for working with US forces.

"Gone are the days never to return when the US could make a unilateral nuclear blackmail against the DPRK," said Rodong Sinmun, using the country's official name.

The Security Council met at the request of Japan, South Korea and the United States to agree on a response, despite resistance from Pyongyang's sole ally China to calls for tougher measures.

But its priority is to avoid the regime's collapse, which would create a crisis on its border and potentially shift the balance of power on the Korean peninsula toward the United States.

BCL man, 3 others blackmail girl on Facebook
Police arrested on Wednesday two youths including a former leader of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) at Chittagong University, who tried to blackmail a college student by threatening to disseminate her doctored nude photos on Facebook.

Rakib Uddin, 24, a master's student of history and executive member of the last BCL committee at CU, which is now dissolved, and Md Farman, 24, a student of Premier University, Chittagong, were arrested at the bus stand of Hathazari upazila in Chittagong, said police.

Rakib, the son of Bokhtiar Uddin, and Farman, the son of Md Harun, live in Hathazari's Fatepur, said Sub-inspector Russell Miah of Khulshi Police Station in the city.

SI Russell said detectives and Khulsi police jointly worked on the matter and baited the four by giving them the details of a Dutch Bangla Bank account and asking them to collect the money from an ATM booth on Wednesday.

Accordingly, the four youths came to the booth in Hathazari bus stand area around 8:00pm, and two of them got caught.

2 Malaysian Airlines staff jailed over tortoise smuggling
Three Malaysian Airlines staff have been arrested by law enforcers for their involvement in smuggling 30 tortoises which were seized at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka last night.

The arrestees are deputy station manager of Malaysian Airlines, Samiur Rahman, 35, passenger service specialist Jewel Ahmed, 29, and baggage handler Mizanur Rahman, 30.

The consignment of tortoises was seized at Departure Belt No.4 at the airport around 6:00pm in the evening yesterday, inside three trolley bags with Malaysian Airlines tags, Senior Deputy Superintendent of Police of Armed Police Battalion (APBn) Alamgir told Bangla daily Prothom Alo.

Contacted, Malaysian Airlines authorities gave the names of three passengers en route to Kuala Lumpur�Rafikul Islam, Shaheen Alam, and SalekMondol�to APBn, who were found not to be involved with the smuggling after interrogation and checking video footages.

Further investigation found that the three Malaysian Airlines officials were involved in the smuggling along with Civil Aviation scan operator Hasan Parvez who managed to escape, the law enforcement official added.

The tortoises were handed over to Ashim Mallick, inspector of Wildlife Crime Control Unit (WCCU) at Forest Department who informed that the tortoises, which were later released at Bangabandhu Safari Park in Gazipur, weigh 85 kilograms and are worth around Tk 10.5 lakh.

DGFI became militants' buddy
Brigadier General ATM Amin, a director of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) then, told a US diplomat on July 19, 2007 that they had infiltrated Harkatul Jihad al Islami, Bangladesh (Huji-B) and they �don't see them attacking western interests".

And, a year later, when DGFI helped this militant outfit's senior members form a political group called Islamic Democratic Party (IDP), Amin attempted to blackmail Awami League President Sheikh Hasina and pressed her to convince the US government to support IDP, according to leaked US diplomatic cables.

It was because of Amin's meddling with the affairs of militants and many other important national issues during post-1/11 days, the then DGFI chief Major General Golam Mohammad in late 2008 had to apologise to US diplomat James F Moriarty and assure him that IDP would not be registered with the Election Commission.

In a meeting on November 12, 2008, Moriarty, the then US ambassador in Dhaka, warned Golam Mohammad that his government vehemently opposed the creation of IDP, formed by senior Huji-B members with DGFI support.

Some of the US diplomatic cables released by the whistleblower website WikiLeaks have many disjointed but interesting descriptions of how Hasina was pressurised to seek US blessings for a militant group turned so-called political party whose members were linked to past attempts to assassinate her.

The US envoy informed the DGFI director general about the October 30, 2008 meeting in Washington between Hasina and Richard Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs.

Hasina in the meet told Boucher that Brig Gen Amin had requested her to urge the US government to support the registration of IDP, Moriarty confided to Golam Mohammad.

Understandably, Hasina was uncomfortable trumpeting the cause of IDP with the Election Commission or the USG [US government]," says a November 17, 2008 cable.

Furthermore, the AL president resented attempts to blackmail her by Amin, who acted as mediator between Hasina and the caretaker regime during her imprisonment in 2007-2008.

Golam Mohammad also reaffirmed that DGFI and Bangladesh government agreed with Moriarty's assessment of IDP and promised to speak with the army chief and EC to ensure the party was not registered.

The US envoy argued that allowing the IDP to continue as a political entity would be a mistake unless Bangladesh government established well-defined condition.

Such condition were akin to "lines in the sand" regarding the expectations and tolerance of Bangladesh government with respect to IDP activities.

Mohammad rationalised that in doing so the Bangladeshi intelligence and security services could monitor and co-opt IDP leaders and arrest those Huji-B members that remained outside of the political process.

Mohammad sought the ambassador's guidance on the best course of action to take with IDP and other Huji-B reformers who wanted to take a more moderate stance and integrate themselves into the Bangladesh political system if establishment of the IDP was not an option.

A July 19, 2007 cable notes, in a meeting with then US charge d'affaires Geeta Pasi, DGFI director Amin had dismissed threats from Huji-B, saying "We have infiltrated Huji-B and we don't see them attacking western interests.�

As for the members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET), he said, �We have remnants of them surrendering."

Amin was very upbeat about Bangladesh's success in defusing the issue of domestic terrorist group Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).

Russia slams Western 'blackmail' over Syria




Russia yesterday defiantly slammed the West for using "blackmail" over a new UN Security Council resolution on Syria and ridiculed the idea it could convince President Bashar al-Assad to step down.

In combative comments that underlined the huge gulf between Russia and its Western partners, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of making an extension of the UN observers mandate in Syria conditional on Russia agreeing sanctions against Damascus.

Troops deployed armoured vehicles near the heart of the Syrian capital for the first time yesterday since an anti-regime uprising broke out last year, activists said.

"This is the first time that armoured and military transport vehicles have been deployed in Al-Midan," Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, referring to the district near central Damascus.

Lavrov bluntly shot down any lingering hopes that Russia could bring about an end to the crisis by persuading Assad to step down, saying the Syrian leader would never quit as he still retained popular support.

The splits between Russia and Western powers risk being played out in a new standoff at the UN Security Council, where the West wants Moscow to back a resolution that would impose new sanctions against Syria.

"To our great regret, we are witnessing elements of blackmail," Lavrov told reporters hours ahead of talks with UN-Arab League Syria envoy Kofi Annan in Moscow.

The looming diplomatic clash at the United Nations comes ahead of a Friday deadline for the end of the current three-month mandate of the UN observer mission in Syria.

G7 warns energy blackmail 'unacceptable'
G7 leaders warned Thursday, in a clear rebuke to Russia, that manipulating energy supplies to intimidate one's neighbours is unacceptable and that they need to diversify their energy systems to avoid getting blackmailed.

Russia supplies about 30 percent of Europe's gas, with about half of that transiting Ukraine.

As the Ukraine crisis has deepened, Russian state-controlled giant Gazprom has doubled gas prices and demanded billions in back payments from cash-strapped Kiev, threatening to turn off the taps if it does not get its money.

Trying to avoid a repeat of the 2006 and 2009 crises when Gazprom cut supplies, the European Union has brought Ukraine and Russia together for talks, with officials due to report back shortly on a possible deal.

The G7 -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and the United States -- said they would do more to diversify supplies and resources to ensure future energy security.

"The crisis in Ukraine makes plain that the energy security must be at the centre of our collective agenda and requires a step change to our approach to diversifying energy supplies and modernising our energy infrastructure," the draft statement said.

Russia accuses US of blackmail
Russia yesterday accused the United States of trying to blackmail it into a tough UN resolution on Syria's chemical weapons, as a mortar round hit Moscow's embassy in Damascus.

Opposing any resolution that implies force, Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday lashed out at Washington.

"Our American partners are beginning to blackmail us: if Russia won't support a resolution under Chapter VII in the UN Security Council, then we will stop the work in the Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons," he told Channel One, Russian agencies said.

The Hague-based OPCW is overseeing the inventory and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons under the agreement.

"Our partners are now blinded by their ideological goal of regime change (in Syria)" Lavrov said.

Lavrov's comments came as a mortar round slammed into the compound of the Russian embassy in Damascus, the first such hit against the site.

Women's rights in the cyber space are abused in many ways in Bangladesh and use of internet and mobile phones to stalk, abuse, intimidate and humiliate women is rampant.

Morphing, cyber stalking and cyber pornography including revenge porn are the most common cyber crimes that target women in Bangladesh.

These incidents are becoming alarmingly common even in the rural areas of Bangladesh.

For these reasons we are yet to see in Bangladesh a successful trial of a cyber crime in its true and real sense.

The Digital Bangladesh vision will not achieve its cherished goals if we fail to secure a safe and creative cyber space for our girls.

Piquets accused of blackmail
Renault have launched criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet junior and Nelson Piquet senior for making false allegations and blackmail in relation to claims that the team conspired to fix the outcome of the 2008 Singapore GP.

These allegations claim that Piquet junior was asked to crash his car deliberately into a wall during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix and so facilitate a victory for his teammate Spaniard Fernando Alonso.

"The ING Renault F1 Team is to attend that meeting and answer allegations that members of the team conspired with Nelson Piquet Jnr to cause a deliberate accident at the 2008 Singapore GP, so that Fernando Alonso might benefit from the resulting safety car.

"However, today the ING Renault F1 Team and its Managing Director Flavio Briatore personally, wish to state that they have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Junior and Nelson Piquet Senior in France concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Mr Piquet Jnr to drive for the remainder of the 2009 season.

"The matter will also be referred to the Police in the UK."

Renault's appearance in Paris later this month will not be the first for Briatore who was associated with various controversies during the 1990s when German Michael Schumacher drove for the team, then owned and named Benetton.

Piquet is reported to have claimed that he was asked to crash deliberately and these claims, as presented in a document that appeared to have been leaked on Thursday, caused uproar at Monza on the eve of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix.

Govt trains teenage girls to fight cybercrime
Bangladesh on Tuesday began training thousands of teenage girls to fight cybercrime, citing an "alarming" rise in social media-related abuses mostly targeting adolescents.

Police said online harassment had grown alarmingly with the rise in smart phone use in Bangladesh, and teenage girls were the main targets.

Some 90 per cent of these victims are pre-teen and teenage girls," Nazmul Islam, a deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told AFP.

Bangladesh in 2013 set up a special trial court to deal with social media-related crimes and since then more than 450 cases have been heard.

ISIL threat in Bangladesh to affect India: Sputnik


A Russian government-sponsored multi-media news service, Sputnik, claims that the moment Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (ISIL or ISIS) is retreating in West Asia following Moscow-backed operations, the militant group is stepping into the South Asian scene.

In a column published on Monday, the Sputnik referred to the claim of credit by ISIS for three gruesome attacks, including killing of two foreigners, in Bangladesh over the past month.

�Any breakdown of Bangladeshi society would result in strong regional aftershocks that would negatively affect India,� the journalist writer observed.

In the column titled �Who wants to turn Bangladesh into Bangla-Daesh?�, the columnist emphasised pondering over which actor would gain the most by turning Bangladesh into Bangla-Daesh.

The article pointed out that the AL is �genuinely recognised as being more pro-Indian and strongly adheres to the country�s secular roots�.

The author mentioned that Russian president Putin warned last week in Valdai that �some terrorists are used as a battering ram to overthrow the regimes that are not to one�s liking�.

He also referred to prime minister Sheikh Hasina�s accusing of BNP chief Khaleda Zia (now in UK) of �conspiring from abroad to tarnish the country's image through killing foreigners�.

It went on saying that an ISIL-initiated terrorist war in Bangladesh could ruin all of India�s regional initiatives.

�The trans-border humanitarian and terrorist overflow could drastically destabilise India and set off a chain reaction of conflict inside the country itself,� cautioned the article.

�The viability of its Act East strategy and the ASEAN Road are dependent on internal conditions in Bangladesh that are beyond their control, but are dangerously threatening to explode and take the whole region down with it,� the author noted.

Expanding on this insight, he said, �It wouldn�t be unreasonable to wonder whether the same culprit responsible for destroying the Mideast might be the one that�s using the threat of terrorism in Bangladesh to blackmail India away from its Eurasian BRICS partners.�


�

Reporters Without Borders highlighted several cases of journalists punished by their governments, including that of Raef Badawi, a Saudi citizen-journalist who won the organisation�s Press Freedom Prize this year.

He was sentenced in September to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for �insulting Islam� with his views on the Liberal Saudi Network.

It also highlighted the case of Khadija Ismailova in Azerbaijan -- �now Europe�s biggest prison for media personnel�.

China is the world leader in imprisoning journalists, with 29 currently behind bars, followed closely by Eritrea (28) and Iran (19).

Having already spent seven years in prison in China, she is again on trial for �divulging state secrets� to a German broadcaster.

Forty-seven Libyan and 37 Syrian reporters fled their homeland in the past year.

A crackdown on privately-owned Ethiopian media drove 31 journalists into exile.

Beatings and rough handling were most common in Ukraine, followed by Venezuela and Turkey -- a symptom of the targeted violence used by police in attempting to suppress protests in those countries this year.

India names black money holders
India's government revealed Monday the names of three businessmen accused of illegally stashing funds in foreign bank accounts as it seeks to recover billions of untaxed dollars parked abroad.

In 2011 French authorities informed India of around 700 Indians with Swiss accounts.

Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based group that tracks money transfers, said Indians surreptitiously shifted $344 billion overseas between 2002 and 2011, depriving India of vital tax revenues.

But that money abroad is a fraction of illicit funds concealed in India, experts say.

The Dabur group said in a statement that Burman opened his "legally allowed" foreign account while he was a non-resident Indian.

Another person named in Monday's affidavit, Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhiya, chairman of western Indian jewellery-and-real estate firm Shreeji Trading, told reporters he had complied with tax laws and had no foreign account.

It�s shock, anger and sadness.�

Lamine Diack, from whom Coe took over the mantle of IAAF president in August, was on Wednesday charged by French police with corruption over suspicions he took bribes worth more than one million euros ($1.09 million) to cover up doping cases involving Russian athletes.

Asked whether he had been in touch with Lamine Diack, the 82-year-old Senegalese who he had praised as the �spiritual leader� of the IAAF when he won the election to succeed him, Coe replied: �No.�

Coe added: �I�m determined more than ever that we will drive the review that I started the day after I became elected.

�You potentially have a bunch of old men who put a whole lot of extra money in their pockets-through extortion and bribes - but also caused significant changes to actual results and final standings of international athletics competitions.�

The report is expected to be critical of both the IAAF and Russian athletics officials.

�I�m not benchmarking the current situation we�re in with any other sport or any other organisation,� the former British conservative politician said.

�I will be taking to the IAAF Council meeting in Monaco in November a raft of reforms and changes and I expect to get them through.

Azerbaijan jails top journalist
Azerbaijan on Tuesday sentenced award-winning investigative journalist and anti-graft campaigner Khadija Ismayilova to seven and a half years in jail on corruption charges she denounced as trumped-up, her lawyer said.

The journalist has fearlessly probed the alleged vast riches amassed by President Ilham Aliyev and his family, which have ruled Azerbaijan with an iron fist since it gained independence in 1993.

In a leaked diplomatic cable from 2009 published by WikiLeaks, Aliyev is said to have described her as an �enemy of the government�, asking the US ambassador to intervene to have her sacked by Radio Liberty.

In December, Azerbaijani police raided and closed the Baku offices of Radio Liberty in a move that Washington called deeply disturbing, aggravating concerns about the treatment of non-state media in the Caucasus nation.

�Enemy of the government�

The US State Department urged the government to release Ismayilova, saying that the case was �another example in a broad pattern of increasing restrictions on human rights� in the country.

Rights groups have accused the government of Azerbaijan of stepping up pressure on opponents after Aliyev�s reelection for a third term in 2013.

The high-profile trials kicked off after Azerbaijan in June hosted with great fanfare the inaugural edition of the European Games, a sporting extravaganza billed as Europe�s answer to the Olympics.

Freedom House says there are now more than 80 political prisoners in Azerbaijan.

Human Rights Watch called Ismayilova�s jailing �outrageous� and said it �shows the Azerbaijani authorities� willingness to subvert the law to exact revenge against critics�.

Greek PM calls referendum on bailout for July 5
Greece will hold a referendum on July 5 on the outcome of negotiations with its international creditors taking place in Brussels on Saturday, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced.

Tsipras spoke ahead of a critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Saturday, amid heightened anxiety over a possible Greek default next Tuesday that could potentially spark its exit from the euro, and even from the European Union.

Greece rejected its international creditors� offer of a five-month, 12-billion-euro ($13.4-billion) extension of its bailout programme on Friday, arguing it was unacceptable.

�For the last six months, the Greek government has led the fight... to find a viable agreement that respects democracy,� Tsipras said in his address broadcast on Greek television.

�Democracy deserved a boost in euro-related matters,� Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis tweeted following the referendum declaration.

Let the people decide.�

The creditors�the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund�insist Greece must seal a deal this weekend to avoid an IMF default early next week.

However the Greek government argued the reforms demanded alongside the bailout extension would be �recessionary� and the funding �inadequate�.

Questioned if eurozone ministers would discuss the current proposal, or a plan B if Greece has rejected the offer, the official replied: �That we will see.

A number of countries want to debate plan B.�

Varoufakis said earlier Greece had a �duty� to reach agreement with its international creditors on Saturday.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Athens on Friday not to waste an �extraordinarily generous� offer.

Creditors are ready to quickly disburse 1.8 billion euros in financial aid to help Athens meet a 1.5 billion euro IMF debt repayment due next Tuesday, on June 30, as long as the Greek parliament approves disputed reforms, according to the proposals seen by AFP.

Tsipras told Merkel and French President Francois Hollande on Friday that he could not understand the creditors� �harsh� stance and asked for leeway.

Under the proposal, an immediate 1.8-billion-euro disbursement�profits from Greek bonds held by the European Central Bank�would be paid �as soon as the Greek parliament has approved with a resolution the agreement with the (creditor) institutions and adopted a first set of legislative actions�.

Greece also wants debt cut as part of a solution to the five months of bitter negotiations over the unlocking of the final 7.2 billion euro ($8.1 billion) payout from its current extension, which expires on June 30.

UN presses Yemen militia to cede power
The United Nations Security Council on Sunday urged Yemen's Huthis to cede power, release President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi and negotiate in "good faith," after the Shiite militia vowed to defy the body's "threats."

Yemen is a traditional US ally in the fight against Al-Qaeda, but the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country has descended into chaos since the Huthis overran the capital in September.

In another city they captured last year, Ibb in central Yemen, Huthis fired on hundreds of protesters to disperse them on Sunday, wounding several.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has warned that Yemen is falling apart and called for Hadi's reinstatement.

Citing security concerns, nine Arab and Western countries shuttered their embassies in Yemen last week and evacuated diplomats.

UN's first resolution:

Western diplomats said Russia, which is already under US and European sanctions over its annexation of Crimea and backing of rebels in eastern Ukraine, was reluctant to vote for sanctions.

It was the council's first resolution on Yemen since the Huthis grabbed power in a move the United States and Gulf Arab countries described as a "coup."

The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council said Saturday it would act if the rival factions in Yemen fail to resolve their differences, without elaborating.

The 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) voiced support for the GCC statement, and the Arab League said it will hold an emergency meeting on Yemen on Wednesday.

Accusations of torture:

In their bid to establish authority across Yemen, the militiamen have tried to stifle opposition and have been accused of detaining and torturing opponents.

The Huthis are accused of receiving support from Shiite-dominated Iran, which criticised the "hasty action" of closing embassies in Sanaa, and insisted the Huthis were fighting "corruption and terrorism."

In a statement issued at the end of a meeting in the south's main city Aden, leaders of the three provinces demanded Hadi's reinstatement and affirmed their support for Yemen becoming a federation based on the outcome of a national dialogue held last year

The ugly incident occurred during a play staged by students of Dhaka University's Theatre and Performance Studies Department.

It was part of the ongoing International Theatre Festival organised by the International Theatre Institute and Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.

There were theatre goers and also members of a Chinese troupe who have been performing at the festival at the venue when this unsavoury incident took place.

An assault on state immunity
On 28 September 2016, ignoring the veto of the then US President Barack Obama , both houses of the US Congress enacted the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA).

It confers US federal courts jurisdiction over civil claims against a foreign state for any death, physical injury, or damage to property occurring in the USA resulting from an act of international terrorism, and also for torts committed anywhere by an official, agent, or employee of a foreign country who acted within the course of their employment.

It is bewildering that the passion and desire to respond to the demands of their constituencies could sway US lawmakers to forget international legal norms and JASTA's foreign policy imperatives.

Compared to most other countries, the immunity of foreign states in the USA was already quite thin (even before JASTA, US nationals could sue foreign states for sponsoring terrorism provided that the US Department of State designated such a state as a sponsor of terrorism).

Having said that, JASTA would be likely perceived quite negatively by the international community (not just states affected by this law), as the undue localisation of a global concern by the United States.

Some wide-ranging US laws such as the extra-territorial application of alien tort claims have for many years raised eyebrows in other countries.

When a corporate actor or individual does business in the US or has a nexus to the US, they are required to accept the jurisdiction of the US courts.

With JASTA, the United States is truly poking the tiger with a very short stick because now all that is required to deny state immunity to a foreign country is a mere allegation by a plaintiff of an act of terrorism (which could very well be a controversial political act), and payment of the requisite court fees.

Then, considering the present situation between US and Saudi Arabia, whatever political and/or economic imperatives that may persuade one to believe that Saudi Arabia will abide by judgements of the US federal courts, should also be applicable when arguing as to why Saudi Arabia might agree to establish a Mixed Claims Commission or accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ, in addition to the consequent preservation of its sovereign immunity.

Abdul Jalil Bhuyian, former secretary general of a faction of Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists, said the attack on journalists is basically an attack on the free press.

Terming the attack shameful, Shaban Mahmud, president of Dhaka Union of Journalists, urged the home minister to bring the guilty police personnel to book and ensure security of journalists.

A day later, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia said guilty police men would get punished as per the gravity of their offence after analysing the report.

Bird smuggling bid foiled




Customs officials yesterday seized around 1,000 birds, mostly protected species, from a Pakistani at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in the capital.

He was trying to smuggle the birds in four cages packed in cartons to Pakistan, said a customs official.

He said the birdcages were boarded on flight PK-267 of Pakistan International Airlines scheduled to take off at 2:30pm.

He had a veterinary certificate from Dhaka City Corporation, which customs official Zamal thinks is fake.

Quoting the arrestee, range officer of the forest department Fazlul Haq said Ahmmed Shaikh Wahid collected the birds from another Pakistani citizen Faruk who is in Dhaka now.

He said a case was filed against the Pakistani citizen under Wildlife Preservation Act 1974.

Video shows assault on Kim's half-brother
CCTV footage purportedly showing the deadly assault in Malaysia on the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by a woman, who is believed to have wiped a fast-acting poison on his face, was released by Japanese broadcaster Fuji TV today.

Kim Jong Nam died last Monday a short time after the attack in the departure hall of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, where he had been preparing to take a flight to Macau.

Malaysian police have detained four suspects - a Vietnamese woman, an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man, and North Korean man - and are on the hunt for four other North Koreans who fled the country on the day of the attack.

The killing has triggered a diplomatic spat between Malaysia and North Korea, which has opposed an autopsy and demanded that the body be handed over directly.

Police have said the four North Korean suspects fled Malaysia on the day of the attack, but declined to give details.

According to The Star, a Malaysian daily, they returned to Pyongyang via Jakarta, Dubai, and Vladivostok.

South Korean and US officials believe Kim Jong Nam was killed by agents from the reclusive North.

South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn told a meeting of South Korea's National Security Council on Monday that it was nearly certain that North Korea was behind the killing of Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.

Kim Jong Nam, 46, who has been living in the Chinese territory of Macau under Beijing's protection, had spoken out publicly against his family's dynastic control of the isolated, nuclear-armed nation.

DMP Gulshan zone Deputy Commissioner Mostaque Ahmed Khan told The Daily Star at the spot that the situation was under control of the police.

Later in the day, NSU authorities, Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), Bashundhara Group authorities held an emergency meeting with the students� representatives at the university�s Proctor�s Office.

Soon after the incident, he was taken to Apollo Hospitals from where he was shifted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH).

All these reports of a deteriorating law and order situation have naturally been causing despondency among citizens.

The latest that we have here is the organised assault by about 20 to 25 Chhatra League activists on the assistant commissioner (land) in Kachua upazila of Chandpur district simply because the latter tried to stop them from constructing a shop on government land.

Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB) in a statement condemned the incident and termed it an "unforgivable offence".

Abdul Jalil Bhuyian, general secretary of Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists, said such an attack on journalists is a nasty interference in the mass media, and journalists should unite to protest this kind of incidents.

He said he submitted Demand Order letters to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid seeking their permission to charge extra

Tk 20,000 as donation money for admission of new students to Monipur High School since new branches of the school are not listed for the government's monthly payment order (MPO).

Detectives today claimed to have arrested the mastermind of a gold smuggling syndicate operating in Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai, India and Bangladesh.

The capture of nine persons, scheduled to fly for Malaysia Sunday evening, led to the arrest of the alleged mastermind, Nazrul Islam Liton, 33, at a house in Purana Paltan a day later, when 70 gold bars, Tk 3 lakh in cash, and 5,000 Saudi riyals were also seized from his possession.

"Liton used to purchase gold bars in Dubai and Singapore and send those to Bangladesh for smuggling later to India," DB Joint Commissioner Monirul Islam said at a press briefing at Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) media centre this morning.

Police obtained information about the movements of the syndicate after quizzing assistant aircraft mechanic of Biman Bangladesh Airlines Mohammad Anisuddin, who was arrested in connection with the gold haul incident, said Monirul.

Police also sized nine passports and visas, 12 mobile phone sets, and foreign currencies of Tk 35 lakhs including that of Malaysia, Singapore and Bangladesh from the gang, he said.

Probe sexual assault during Baishakh celebration: HC
The High Court today directed the authorities concerned to investigate the incidents of sexual assault on women on the Dhaka University campus Tuesday evening during the Pahela Baishakh celebration.

Home secretary, IGP, VC of DU, commissioner of Dhaka metropolitan police, deputy commissioner of police of Ramna division and officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station have been made respondents to the rule.

Witnesses said some 30 to 40 rowdy youths assaulted and sexually harassed around 20 women for about one hour at the Suhrawardy Udyan gate near the TSC area around 6:00pm.

The CCTV footage that police released yesterday clearly shows multiple incidents of sexual assault on women by rowdy men during the Pahela Baishakh celebrations on the Dhaka University campus.

Jahangir Alam Sarker, acting deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told The Daily Star that what happened was �some jostling�, not sexual assault.

And this footage is not even of the Suhrawardy Udyan entrance opposite the TSC, the spot where more severe incidents of sexual assault reportedly took place.

Reports also mentioned that a rescuer, Liton Nandi, president of Bangladesh Chhatra Union's Dhaka University chapter, gave his panjabi to a victim whose dress was ripped at places.

The footage obtained by this paper does not show this incident, but that is no proof that it did not happen because the footage are from cameras that watched the footpaths along the Suhrawardy Udyan.

Some 19 cameras were installed around the Suhrawardy Udyan alone.

Trump denies sex assault 'lies,' faces first lady rebuke
Donald Trump savaged US media for reporting "outright lies" that he groped and forcibly kissed women, as First Lady Michelle Obama blasted the Republican nominee in a powerful tirade.

Just 26 days before the American electorate chooses a successor to her husband on November 8, a visibly angry first lady delivered a fiery takedown of the real estate mogul and his "disgraceful" behavior.

"Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say, enough is enough," Obama told a rally for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire.

Her husband turned up the heat later on Thursday, jetting to the key swing state of Ohio to lash Republicans tight to their sinking ship.



At least six women have accused Trump of making unwanted physical advances in accounts reported by The New York Times, NBC, People Magazine and others, most of them after Trump asserted in Sunday's debate with Clinton that he had never sexually assaulted a woman.

With his campaign in free-fall and sliding in the polls, Trump pounded the battleground states of Florida and Ohio, denying the alleged incidents occurred and turning the guns on his opponent.

Trump said his lawyers were preparing a lawsuit against The New York Times -- which published the accounts of two women who accused him of groping and kissing them -- unless the paper retracts the article.

- 'Tongue down my throat' -

A photographer's assistant alleged that Trump grabbed her rear at his Florida estate in 2003, where a former writer for People accused Trump of forcibly kissing her during an interview to mark his wedding anniversary with then pregnant third wife Melania in 2005.

Trump rejected the claims again at a speech to young voters in Columbus, Ohio.

In an evening rally in Cincinnati, Trump sought to get back on message, blasting Clinton as "corrupt" and repeating his pledge to hire a special prosecutor to investigate her email scandal

"She should be locked up," he told a rally of thousands.

In a sinister note Thursday, he charged that Clinton met "in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers."

The former secretary of state, visiting a campaign field office in San Francisco, briefly addressed the ugliness of the presidential race.

"We cannot let this pessimism, this dark and divisive and dangerous vision of America, take hold in anybody's heart," she said.

"There's hardly any part of America that he's not targeted."

Four bodies of suspected militants including a woman were recovered from the hideout in Premtala area earlier in the day, reports our Chittagong correspondent quoting police.

Four hours after the drive, Chittagong range Deputy Inspector General of Police Shafiqul Islam told the media that the drive codenamed �Assault 16� had ended and confirmed the death of four suspected militants.

Later, police found the child�s body lying inside the flat used as the den of the terrorist outfit, said Habibur Rahman, additional superintendent of police in Chittagong.

Its coordinator Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury -- killed along with his two accomplices in an operation at a militant den in Narayanganj on August 27, 2016, -- was thought to be the Gulshan attack mastermind.

Twenty members of seven families, who were trapped inside the building during the overnight raid, were taken to safety before the final assault began around 6:00am this morning, our Chittagong correspondent quoting the DIG.

Protesting Assault On Son: Elderly freedom fighter beaten up
Eighty-eight-year-old freedom fighter was severely beaten up by some of his villagers in Ishwarganj upazila as he protested assault on his son over a trivial matter on Saturday.

Quoting locals and the victim's family, Badrul Alam Khan, officer-in-charge of Ishwarganj Police Station, said Imam's son Jalal Uddin went to a local bazar to have a cup of tea on Saturday noon when arbitration on a land dispute was going on there.

Imam filed a case with Ishwarganj Police Station, accusing five people, including Ruhul, Nurul and Robiqul, on Sunday night, said OC Badrul.

Abdus Sattar, commander of Ishwarganj upazila Muktijoddha unit, also visited Imam at the hospital.

In the video that was shown by various news channels in India and went viral on social media, the youth can be seen repeatedly punching and slapping the couple.

Dipak Kumar Das, a sub-inspector of the Detective Branch of police, who headed the investigation into the case, filed the report with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate�s Court of Dhaka this afternoon.

The joyous celebration of the Bangalee's biggest festival -- Pahela Baishakh -- was tainted by incidents of sexual assault on women on the Dhaka University campus on the evening of April 14 this year, sparking widespread public outrage.

Witnesses said some 30 to 40 rowdy youths assaulted and sexually harassed around 20 women for about one hour at the Suhrawardy Udyan gate near the TSC area around 6:00pm.

However, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mohammad Asaduzzaman Miah claimed no incident of sexual assault took place on the campus on Tuesday.

DMP installed around 19 CCTV cameras in the Shahbagh area with three to four cameras positioned right around the spot, said Sirajul Islam, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station.

Liton Nandi, president of Bangladesh Chhatra Union's DU unit, said a group of youths tore off almost the whole of a 25-year-old woman's clothes in front of the Suhrawardy Udyan gate.

Sub-inspector Mohiuddin Ratan of Kotwali Police Station filed one of the cases against five named and 400 to 450 unnamed persons.

The other case (no-46), filed by Shafiqul Islam Shwapan, supervisor of the swimming pool construction project, was filed against 59 named BCL leaders including its Chittagong city unit president Emran Ahammed Emu and general secretary Nurul Azim Rony.

Also, to avoid public sufferings, we wanted to hold a rally inside the stadium when police barred our entry and swooped on us.�

�We have also submitted a memorandum to the commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police in this regard,� he said.

He also said the Chittagong city unit of BCL yesterday postponed a rally they called protesting the police action.

Meanwhile, when asked about the future of the construction project, Chittagong City Corporation Mayor and city unit Awami League General Secretary AJM Nasir Uddin said, �I see no obstacle.

We have taken a decision to implement the project anyhow��

Nasir said this while talking to reporters after inaugurating CJKS Mayor Gold Cup Inter-Ward Football Tournament at MA Aziz Stadium yesterday.

On his knees and his shirt torn off, he was surrounded by several policemen and beaten up inside the Shahbagh Police Station, a photograph shows.

Alim had three stitches on his right eyebrow and Ishan too took treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

The national committee enforced the eight-hour shutdown from 6:00am yesterday in the capital to press home its demand of scrapping Rampal Power Plant project near the Sundarbans.

But police used tear gas, water cannon and charged batons on the demonstrators in the capital's Shahbagh to disperse them.

Around 12:45pm, I was standing beside Shahbagh Police Station gate.

Meanwhile, police authorities suspended Assistant Sub-Inspector Ershad of Shahbagh Police Station for his alleged involvement in the assault.

Besides, 12 other policemen were initially found involved in the incident and an inquiry was going on, Maruf Hossain Sorder, deputy commissioner (Ramna division) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told The Daily Star.

A three-member probe committee, led by additional deputy commissioner (Ramna division) of DMP Navid Kamal Shaibal, has been formed to investigate the incident.

The ATN News authorities sent a written complaint to Shahbagh Police Station against four policemen, including ASI Ershad, and several other policemen without naming, said Abu Bakar Siddique, officer-in-charge of the police station.

In a press release, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust condemned the incident of beating up the journalists.

Neo JMB leader killed in gunfight with cops
A suspected top leader of �Neo JMB� and another key operative of the organisation were killed in a �gunfight� with police in Bogra's Sherpur upazila yesterday.

Khaled, a military commander of the northern region, masterminded the attack on Italian physician Piero Parolari, the bomb attack at Kantaji Mandir, the attack on Iskcon temple and looting of a petrol pump in Dinajpur in November and December last year, said Gaziur Rahman, senior assistant superintendent of police in Bogra.

Moreover, Khaled, Nazrul Islam alias Bike Hasan, Jahangir Alam alias Rajib Gandi and Khairul Islam Badhon, one of the Gulshan caf� attackers, had a meeting at Ripon's house in Rajshahi's Boalia, where they plotted to kill Rajshahi University Prof AFM Rezaul Karim Siddiquee, police said.

THE �GUNFIGHT�

On information that some militants gathered at Noluabari intersection in Bishapul union to carry out subversive activities, a police team rushed to the spot around 3:30am, said Sherpur Police Station's Officer-in-Charge Khan Md Erfan.

They were taken to Bogra Police Lines Hospital.

KHALED

Khaled was the son of Enamul Haque of Hamidpur village in Chapainawabganj's Nachole upazila.

He passed Alim (HSC equivalent) from Chapainawabganj and got enrolled in Dinajpur Paramedical College.

Bazlur Rashid, a sub-inspector of Detective Branch of police in Dinajpur, said Khaled planned the attacks and supplied arms and explosives to the JMB men who took part in the three attacks.

Ripon's name appeared in the charge sheet of the cases along with 17 Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh men.

The group was planning to kill Hindu homeopath doctor Nirendronath Sarker of Bagmara upazila, police said.

Law enforcers came to know about his involvement after checking the mobile phones of two of his accomplices -- Aminul Islam Rumi and Enamul Haque Sabuj -- who were arrested in Bagmara on August 16, police claimed.

The group had six members, including Shariful Islam, a third-year student of English department at Rajshahi University and the prime suspect in the murder case of Prof Siddiquee, Rawshan Ali alias Akash of Pabna and Bulbul alias Al Amin alias Billal of Rajshahi.

Ripon, son of late Golam Sabur Badal of Panthanpar in Bagmara, had been missing since May 19, his sister Samina Ferdous told The Daily Star yesterday.

After passing Higher Secondary Examination from Rajshahi University School five to six years ago, he started working at a sanitary shop in Rajshahi city's Malopara.

Detective Branch of Rajshahi Metropolitan Police yesterday picked up Samina, her husband Hafijul Islam, uncle Abdus Salam and Salam's son Milu for interrogation, said RMP Inspector Rezaus Sadik.

[Our Bogra, Rajshahi and Dinajpur correspondents contributed to the report.]

Bangladesh's Hindu community once again is under grievous assault.

In the aftermath of the recent general elections, hundreds of Hindus have fled their homes in such regions as Thakurgaon, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra, Lalmonirhat, Rajshahi, Jessore and Chittagong.

Once again, there is an eerie reminder of the trauma the Bangalee nation, especially its Hindu segment, faced in the course of the War of Liberation when the occupation Pakistan army and its local collaborators went after the proponents of Bangalee nationalism.

A very large-scale exodus of Hindus took place at the time of the partition of India in August 1947, when for understandable reasons it became a question of the survival of the community in a country fashioned out of a so-called two-nation theory.

Three years later, in 1950, communal riots led to a newer group of Hindus leaving what was then East Pakistan and making their way to neighbouring West Bengal in India.

In 1964, through the instigation of the Ayub-Monem clique in Pakistan, more Hindus left East Pakistan.

In 1971, the Pakistan army went with a vengeance after Bangladesh's Hindus, an outrage that was to go on for nine long months.

In the process, the soldiers not only killed such revered Hindu figures as Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta, Govinda Chandra Dev, Dhirendranath Dutta and others but also mowed down hundreds of Hindu students who resided at Jagannath Hall of Dhaka University.

Things ought to have been different in independent Bangladesh.

Over these past four decades, many more Hindus have left Bangladesh, with most trekking off to India.

Hindu homes have been vandalised for close to four decades; Hindu temples have been destroyed; Hindu-owned property has been looted systematically; Hindus have been looked upon as Indian agents.

Where were the measures that should have ensured their security as citizens of Bangladesh?

It is now for the state of Bangladesh to reassure its Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and its indigenous people that this country is a secular geographical entity, that it is home to all its people, that an attack on one community is an attack on every community, that those who from now on attempt to humiliate any community will be dealt with summarily and with an iron hand.

President Donald Trump's "global gag rule" cutting US funding to groups that offer abortion services and Russia's decision to ease punishment for domestic violence are casting a long shadow on the annual gathering of the Commission on the Status of Women.

"Globally, women are suffering new assaults on their safety and dignity," Guterres told the opening session of the conference at UN headquarters in New York.

Trump, who declared himself opposed to abortion during his campaign, signed a decree just days into his presidency barring US funding for foreign non-governmental groups if their work touches on abortion.

A few weeks later, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill that reduces penalties for domestic violence to a fine instead of a jail term, if the assault is a first offence and does not cause serious injury.

The committee recommended that the university file a complaint with Bangladesh Press Council against the newspapers that ran �untrue news reports� maligning the dignity of the BSMMU and its vice chancellor.

�But, we will give it to you�at the soonest possible time.�

The syndicate, the highest decision-making body of the university, had formed a seven-member committee, headed by syndicate member Rustom Ali Farazi, MP, to investigate the allegation.

There were allegations that 76 applicants from Tangail scored more than 80 in written test and 23 of them were from Ghatail -- the home upazila of VC Prof Kamrul Hassan Khan.

Mazar-i-Sharif attack: Survivors recall Taliban assault
Survivors of a deadly Taliban assault on an Afghan military base described leaping from windows to escape gunmen shooting soldiers as they prayed, as grieving families today collected coffins draped in the Afghan flag.

Afghan officials have said more than 100 soldiers were killed or wounded in the assault on the base outside the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif Friday, the latest and potentially deadliest in a string of attacks on military targets.

An Afghan army source at the base told AFP the death toll could be as high as 150, and said most of the soldiers were young recruits there for training.

The attack underscores rising insecurity as Afghanistan braces for an intense spring fighting season.

Afghan security forces, beset by killings and desertions, have been struggling to beat back insurgents since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.

The ghastly incident that has shocked the nation comes only a month after a string of assaults on women that took place during the Bangla New Year festival, where organised goons sexually harassed a number of women at the heart of Dhaka University campus and that too under the very nose of some close circuit television cameras.

Be it the gang-rape of the Garo women or the mass molestation of women in the Dhaka University campus, the epitome of our secular progressive movement, the police's way of handling of cases of sexual harassment leaves a lot to be desired.

Some of the widely accessed websites from Bangladesh cater solely to the viewing of explicit adult content.

Of late all young adults in Bangladesh have been given some sex education at the secondary level, but it misses to teach something very basic: how to respect the fairer gender or to see women as an equal partner in life.

Bill Cosby charged with indecent assault
Prosecutors in the US have charged comedian Bill Cosby with aggravated indecent assault over an alleged incident in 2004.

Andrea Constand says she was drugged then assaulted at the Philadelphia home of the former US television star.

Kevin Steele, a district attorney in Montgomery County near Philadelphia, said his office had reopened the Constand case after "new information came to light".

In testimony seen by the New York Times and published in July, Cosby admitted he had given women a sedative, Quaaludes, when he wanted to have sex with them, but not without their knowledge.

At the height of his fame from The Cosby Show, the comedian was the highest paid entertainer on US television.

Russian ambassador shot dead in Ankara
Turkish police secure the area near an art gallery where the Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrei Karlov was shot in Ankara.

The Russian ambassador to Ankara was shot dead in an attack at an art gallery in the Turkish capital on Monday by a gunman shouting �Don't forget Aleppo�.

A Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman confirmed the death of envoy Andrei Karlov, which marked one of the most serious spillovers of the Syria conflict into Turkey.

Russia is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its air strikes were instrumental in helping Syrian forces end rebel resistance last week in the northern city of Aleppo.

A video showed the attacker shouting: �Don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria!�

As screams rang out, the gunman could then be seen pacing about and shouting as he held the gun in one hand and waved the other in the air.

Russia and Turkey have both been involved in the conflict in Syria, which borders Turkey.

Turkey has been a staunch opponent of Assad, while Russia has deployed troops and its air force in support of the Syrian leader.

The US State Department, involved in diplomatic contacts with Russia in an attempt to resolve a refugee crisis unfolding around the city of Aleppo, condemned the attack.

Tensions have escalated in recent weeks as Russian-backed Syrian forces have fought for control of the eastern part of the city of Aleppo, triggering a stream of refugees.

Islamic State militants have been active in Turkey and carried out several bomb attacks on Turkish targets over the last year.

JMB planned for terror attacks
India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) yesterday announced cash rewards for the arrest of 12 absconders wanted in an alleged conspiracy to target installations in Bangladesh.

It also gave details of plans to carry out terror strikes in Bangladesh and India.

All the absconders and the three arrestees are members of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), according to the NIA.

Meanwhile, the NIA, which is probing the October 2 explosion in Burdwan, will send a dossier to Bangladesh to help the country solve the case as it appears that JMB had plans to carry out a series of explosions in Bangladesh, sources said.

The three accused are believed to have told interrogators that explosive devices were transported to Bangladesh by absconders Sheikh Kausar and Kadir for terror activities.

Sheikh Kausar had married an Indian girl named Jannat in 2007 and acquired Indian identity.

One of the motives of JMB was to target young females from poor families to indoctrinate them into jihadi ideology and encourage them to marry Bangladeshi youth so that the men can gain residency in India and Indian identity.

Among the absconders, Kausar, Nasirullah and Sajid, the main accused, are believed to be Bangladesh nationals while Talha Sheikh, Maulana Yusuf Sheikh, Amjad Ali Sheikh, Habibur Rahman Sheikh, Abdul Kalam, Burhan Sheikh, Rejaul Karim and Jahirul Shaikh are residents of West Bengal.

JMB's network in West Bengal and Assam states was set up with the purpose of building an Islamic state in Bangladesh as well as in the three West Bengal districts -- Murshidabad, Nadia, Malda -- through armed struggle, official sources said.

The arrestees claimed that a Bangladeshi national, identified as Sajid, and wife Fatima were the �lead trainers� at Simulia where people were being trained in carrying out various terror activities.

Meanwhile, Indian government's Enforcement Directorate, which deals with foreign exchange violation cases, has registered a money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against suspected Indian operatives and JMB to probe "terror funding" crimes in the aftermath of the Burdwan blast.

Turkey detains six after Russian ambassador shot dead
A man identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas holds up a gun after shooting Andrei Karlov, the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, at a photo gallery in Ankara, Turkey, Monday.

Turkish police detained six people over the killing of the Russian ambassador, state media said on Tuesday, widening a probe to relatives of the off-duty policeman who shouted �Don�t forget Aleppo!� as he gunned the envoy down.

The war, which has killed more than 300,000 people and created a power vacuum exploited by Islamic State, reached a potential turning point last week when Syrian forces ended rebel resistance in the northern city of Aleppo.

Russia, an ally of president Bashar al-Assad, supported that advance with air strikes.

Turkey identified the killer as 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altintas, who had worked for the Ankara riot police for 2-1/2 years.

One senior Turkish security official said investigators were focusing on whether Altintas had links to the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara blames for a failed July coup.

�Don�t forget Aleppo, don�t forget Syria.

Only death can take me from here,� he shouted in Turkish.

Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday he and Russia�s Vladimir Putin had agreed in a telephone call that their cooperation in fighting terrorism should be even stronger after the killing.

Putin said it was aimed at derailing Russia�s attempts to find, with Iran and Turkey, a solution for the Syria crisis.

Turkey faces multiple security threats, including from Islamic State.

Earlier this month a spokesman for the hardline Sunni Muslim group urged global sympathisers to carry out new attacks, singling out Turkish diplomatic, military and financial interests as preferred targets.

Altintas also shouted �We are the ones who swore allegiance to Mohammed for the jihad!�, which the mass circulation Hurriyet newspaper said that was a slogan commonly used in propaganda videos of the group formerly allied to al Qaeda in Syria.

Media present at the event Karlov was attending, an exhibition of photographs from Russia, captured the killing in graphic details.

Foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the street where the Russian embassy is located would be named after the ambassador.

The gallery where the shooting occurred is opposite the US embassy.

A gun was fired in front of the embassy overnight and the United States said its three missions in Turkey would be closed on Tuesday.

He was declared dead at about 7:30pm by doctors at Rangapur Medical College Hospital where he was rushed at about 6:40pm, said Rangpur superintendent of police Mizanur Rahman.

Awami League central organising secretaries Jahangir Kabir Nanok and BM Mozammel Haque left for Gaibandha at about 9:30pm on Saturday.

Manzurul Islam Liton

�The miscreants went to the house as visitors as many others of the locality did usually in the evening�They fired at least three bullets, at least two of which pierced Manzurul�s chest�he was rushed to Rangpur Medical College Hospital,� said Gaibandha additional superintendent of police Md Rabiul Islam.

Sundarganj police station officer-in-charge Atiar Rahman said that at least five people took part in the murder and they used two motorbikes in the attack.

Rangpur police range deputy inspector general Khandaker Golam Faruk visited the crime scene.

Local union AL leader Moklesur Rahman said that they were suspired by the murder and it was unbelievable that the lawmaker could have been killed inside his house.

Manzurul grabbed the headlines after shooting eight-year-old schoolboy Shahadat Hossain Sourav at Sundarganj on October 2, 2015 allegedly under the influence of alcohol, trigging huge nationwide criticism.

Gaibandha deputy commissioner Md Abdus Samad declined to comment immediately over the firearms.

Nine alleged militants were killed this morning during a special drive of the joint forces in Dhaka�s Kalyanpur, ending an overnight standoff that ensued with a raid to hunt down �militant den�.

- SWAT, Rab, DB, cops conduct operation �Storm 26�

- All JMB militants, says police chief

- Detained militant claims himself �IS operative�

- Bodies sent to DMCH morgue for autopsy

SWAT, Rapid Action Battalion (Rab), Detective Branch of police (DB) and Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) jointly carried out a one-hour operation �Storm 26� from 5:51am.

The bodies were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue for autopsy around 5:00pm.

One militant was detained from the spot with bullet injuries and taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

Inspector General of Police AKM Shahidul Haque, who visited the scene, told reporters that these militants had black outfits similar to those Gulshan cafe attackers were wearing.

�The detained person claims to be an IS member, but we think they are of the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB),� he added.

Police believe the attacks on the Gulshan restaurant and Sholakia Eidgah were both carried out by JMB militants who were trying to wield the emblem of the Islamic State.

CRACKDOWN IN KALYANPUR, OPERATION 'STORM 26'

Mirpur police and Rab carried out the primary crackdown in the multi-storied �Jahaj Building� on road No.

HELD �MILITANT� CLAIMS ISLAMIC STATE LINK



Bangladesh�s police chief later said he was more likely to be a JMB operative � those who carried out Gulshan and Sholakia attacks.

The incident comes as France remains on high alert following a series of jihadist attacks that have claimed over 230 lives since January 2015.

France goes to the polls on April 23 in the first round of a two-stage presidential election in which security is one of the main issues on voters� minds.

�The man took a soldier hostage, he was holding her by the neck and he was threatening two other soldiers with the woman�s rifle,� said a man travelling to the Dominican Republic who gave his name only as Dominique.

The crimes of apartheid
APARTHEID is a powerful word, with evocations of the South African experience and with implications of crimes against humanity.

But now, in a report released on March 15 in Beirut, Lebanon, the UN has proclaimed that Israel �is guilty of the crime of apartheid�.

In 2015, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia was charged by its member-states � the eighteen Arab states in West Asia and North Africa � to study whether Israel has established an apartheid regime.

ESCWA asked two American academics � Richard Falk and Virginia Tilley � to undertake the study.

Tilley had served as a chief research specialist in South Africa�s Human Sciences Research Council, which had produced a study in 2009 showing apartheid-like conditions in Israel and the Palestinian Occupied Territory.

The report that they have now produced makes the �grave charge� that Israel is guilty of apartheid not only in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem � the Occupied Territory � but also within its own boundaries and against the Palestinian refugees.

This is a very sharp report, which will be hard for Israel to ignore.

Israel�s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington DC recently to meet US president Donald Trump.

The Israeli government�s illegal Jewish settlement project in the West Bank and its virtual annexation of East Jerusalem makes it impossible to imagine the establishment of Palestine in that region.

What exists is a one-state, with Israel having exercised its dominion in the entire land west of the Jordan River, but a one-state with an apartheid system, with Israeli Jews in a dominant position over the Palestinians.

The new UN report speaks to this disturbing apartheid situation not only in the Occupied Territory of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but in all of Israel.

One reason why the Israeli government is unwilling to consider a one-state solution with equal rights for all Israelis and Palestinians is what they call a �demographic threat�.

The UN report argues that Israel is a �racial regime� because its institutions are premised on maintaining a Jewish nation by techniques of suppression and expulsion.

Gross discrimination

PALESTINIANS who have Israeli citizenship (ezrahut) do not have the right to nationality (le�um), which means that they can only access inferior social services, face restrictive zoning laws, and find themselves unable freely to buy land.

And those who are exiled to the refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan have absolutely no rights to their homeland.

All Palestinians � whether those who live in Haifa (Israel) or in Ain al-Hilweh (Lebanon) suffer the consequences of Israeli apartheid.

The latest law � the Muezzin Bill � imposes limits on the Muslim call to prayer in Israel and East Jerusalem.

Matters would be less grave if the Israeli political system allowed Palestinians rights to make their case against apartheid-like conditions.

Since this description of the Israeli state renders Palestinians as second-class citizens, their voting rights are reduced to merely an affirmation of their subordination.

Palestinians inside Israel and in the Occupied Territories, as well as in enforced exile, are forbidden to fight to change the terms of politics in Israel.

First, the authors ask that the International Criminal Court investigate the situation in Israel.

Second, the report asks that member states allow �criminal prosecutions of Israeli officials demonstrably connected with the practices of apartheid against the Palestinian people�.

Earlier this year, former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni cancelled a trip to Brussels when she was alerted that the prosecutors there might arrest her using the principle of universal jurisdiction.

Such actions raise the cost to Israel for its apartheid policies.

When the UN Security Council declared late last year that Israel�s settlements in the Occupied Territories were illegal, then there was worry in Israel that Ms. Bensouda would accelerate her work.

Others in Israel said that there was nothing new in the resolution, which neither used the word �grave� to describe the situation nor considered Israeli actions to be a war crime.

If it is acknowledged that Israel is an apartheid state, then this is tantamount to war crime (in the 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions) and to a crime against humanity (in the 1973 Apartheid Convention and the 1998 Rome Statute of the ICC).

India�s reaction

TO PREPARE the ground for prime minister Narendra Modi�s trip to Israel later this year, his foreign secretary S Jaishankar will soon go to Israel.

Word comes from the ministry of external affairs that it is likely that Modi will not visit the Occupied Territories, which will be a snub to Palestine.

India�s overall reaction to this report will define Modi�s attitude towards Israel.

The appearance of this report � and its strong conclusions � should give Modi pause before he shreds decades of consensus for Palestine from India.

Will India take leadership in upholding international law as it did in the fight against South African apartheid?

Or will India back away from high principle and settle for arms deals and empty rhetoric?

US demands �immediate end� to Russian annexation of Crimea
The United States on Thursday reiterated its condemnation of Russia�s annexation of Crimea, vowing to maintain related sanctions until Moscow returns the strategic Black Sea peninsula to Ukraine.

�Crimea is a part of Ukraine.

The United States again condemns the Russian occupation of Crimea and calls for its immediate end,� said acting US state department spokesman Mark Toner in a statement marking the three-year anniversary of Moscow�s takeover of Crimea.

�Our Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine.�

Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula following a military intervention and a hastily organised referendum, which was rejected by the international community.

�The United States does not recognise Russia�s �referendum� of March 16, 2014, nor its attempted annexation of Crimea and continued violation of international law,� said Toner.

�We once again reaffirm our commitment to Ukraine�s sovereignty and territorial integrity.�

In the statement the US also called on Russia to �cease its attempts to suppress freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, association, and religion� among Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians, pro-Ukrainian activists and journalists.

The US and the European Union reacted to the annexation of Crimea by imposing economic sanctions on Russia and Putin�s inner circle.

WCIA finds evidences of war crimes against detained Pak army captain
The War Crimes Investigation Agency on Tuesday said it found evidences of committing war crimes by detained Pakistan army�s Bengali officer Md Shahidullah, 75, of Amirabad of Daudkandi in Comilla.

Addressing a press conference at the agency�s Dhanmondi office in the capital, the agency chief Mohammad Abdul Hannan Khan said that Shahidullah served as a captain of Pakistani army during the Liberation War in 1971 and committed war crimes and crimes against humanity then.

Hannan said that they found Shahidullah �s involvement in murders, abduction, looting, arson attack and torturing people in at several areas of Daudkandi in 1971.

ICT issued arrest warrant against the accused on August 2 in 2016 later on next day he was arrested, he said, adding that the agency found the Pakistani army officer�s involvement in committing three counts of crimes against humanity.

Terror Financing: Rokon gave Neo JMB Tk 80 lakh
Rokonuddin Khondoker, who fled to Syria with his family, and militant suspects Major (retd) Jahidul Islam and Tanvir Kaderi made donations to the �Neo JMB� that carried out the Gulshan Holey Artisan attack, a top investigator said yesterday.

Before leaving for the war-ravaged country, Rokonuddin, a pediatrician of Dhaka Shishu Hospital, asked several of his relatives and others who owed him around Tk 80 lakh to give the money to the radical group instead of paying him back.

Some of them, however, pocketed a portion of the money, said Monirul Islam, chief of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), adding that one who was supposed to pay Rokonuddin Tk 10 lakh gave the group just Tk 30,000.

Rokonuddin, his wife Naima Akhter, an associate professor of Botany of Jessore MM College, their two daughters -- Rezwana Rokon Nadia and Ramita Rokon -- and Nadia's husband Saad Qayes Shishir left their home in Khilgaon in July last year, saying they would visit Malaysia but did not return.

The family reportedly went to Syria, a part of which is a stronghold of the Islamic State (IS), quitting civil service jobs and leaving behind huge properties.

Rokonuddin is now working as a child specialist at an IS-controlled hospital in Syria's Raqqah while his wife is probably teaching children at a school there, said a top police official.

�Neo JMB military commander Major (retd) Jahid� who trained the Gulshan caf� attackers gave all his retirement money and savings to the outfit, said Monirul.

He had got the money selling his flat in Uttara, said police.

Earlier, investigators had found that a portion of the fund for the deadly Gulshan and Sholakia attacks in July had come from a Middle Eastern country.

The amount was Tk 13.40 lakh and it arrived in Bangladesh from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through Hundi, an illegal way of money transferring.

The sender is a sympathiser of �Neo JMB�, an offshoot of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, the investigator had said earlier.

Investigators believe �Neo JMB� carried out the two attacks -- one in Gulshan's Holey Artisan Bakery on July 1 killing 20 hostages and two police officials and the other near the Sholakia Eidgah on July 7 leaving two policemen, a woman and a militant suspect dead.

Prosecution asked to press war crimes charges against Pak army officer Shahidullah
The International Crimes Tribunal -1 on Wednesday directed the prosecution to press war crimes charges against Pakistan occupation army�s Bangali captain Muhammad Shahidullah on May 31.

Shahidullah, 75, of Golaperchar, Daudkandi, Comilla, is in jail custody.

On Tuesday, the WCIA told reporters that during the probe war crimes investigator ZM Altafur Rahman found evidence of Captain Shahidullah�s complicity in war crimes on the soil of Bangladesh during the War of Liberation.

According to the prosecution, the accused took part in three incidents of crimes against humanity that were committed between June 7, 1971 and July 21, 1971 at different places under the then Daudkandi thana.

Only days before the Liberation War began Captain Shahidullah came to his village from the then West Pakistan and immediately reported to the occupation army command at Dhaka Cantonment, the prosecution said.

Later, Shahidullah was posted at Comilla cantonment.

Shahidullah set up a camp of the occupation army at Daudkandi from where he committed murders, arson attacks, looting, abductions, confinement and torture in confinement, the prosecution said.

UN to investigate crimes against Rohingya in Myanmar
The top United Nations human rights body agreed on Friday to send an international fact-finding mission to investigate widespread allegations of killings, rape and torture by security forces against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar�s Rakhine state.

But Myanmar ambassador Htin Lynn, speaking before the decision was taken by consensus, rejected the move as �not acceptable�.

Myanmar�s national commission had just interviewed alleged victims who fled to Bangladesh and would issue its findings by August, he said.

The UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution without a vote, brought by the European Union and supported by countries including the United States that called for �ensuring full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims�.

A UN report issued last month, based on interviews with 220 Rohingya among 75,000 who have fled to Bangladesh since October,

said that Myanmar�s security forces have committed mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya in a campaign that �very likely� amounts to crimes against humanity and possibly ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar�s Lynn, referring to the resolution, said: �Such kind of action is not acceptable to Myanmar as it not in harmony with the situation on the ground and our national circumstances.

Let the Myanmar people choose the best and the most effective course of action to address the challenges in Myanmar.�

�We will be doing what needs to be done and we will do it with great prudence and probity,� he added.

China and India said they would �disassociate� themselves from the consensus, with China�s delegation saying the issue �cannot be solved overnight�.

Continuing problems

NONETHELESS the world being what it is, Sri Lanka is relatively advanced in terms of its post-war normalisation when compared to other countries that have recently experienced conflict.

This was the main reason why the international community was prepared to give the Sri Lankan government another two years in which to implement its promises made in October 2015 to the UNHRC.

They know they cannot take on to themselves what the Sri Lankan government has to do.

The United States under president Donald Trump is the latest example of this reality.

At the present time, Sri Lanka is fortunate in that it has a government that is sincere about making life better for all people, including Tamils.

Jehan Perera is executive director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka.

Prabir, a former reporter Dainik Janakantha, said he was the 1st journalist to write a report about Moosa Bin Shamsher�s complicity in the crimes against humanity in Faridpur in 2001.

Prabir report published in Dainik Janakantha on March 24, 2001 described Moosa�s involvement in killings, looting and raping as collaborator of Pakistan occupation army.

The latest such incident in the long series is a young man being killed in a �gunfight� in gangland fighting in Jessore on Saturday.

'Gunfight' in Bogra: 'Neo JMB chief for northern region' killed
Amijul Islam, killed in a gunfight with police in Bogra early on Thursday, was coordinating the activities of Neo JMB militants across the country and reorganising the outfit's military wing, police said.

He was made the organisation's North Bengal chief based on seniority and expertise in military tactics after the law enforcers had arrested his predecessor Fazlur Rahman Taher alias Raj in Chandpur Pabnapara village of Natore on January 13, Superintendent of Bogra police Md Asaduzzaman told The Daily Star yesterday.

A police press release said Amijul was killed in a gunfight at Jamnagar in Bogra's Sherpur upazila.

His body was later sent to Shahid Ziaur Rahman Medical College in Bogra for an autopsy.

A team of the Bogra Detective Brach of police arrested the 24-year-old from Kella Baroipara village in Rajshahi's Godagari upazila on Tuesday night.

The Neo JMB is an offshoot of the outlawed Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).

Jahangir Alam alias Rajib Gandhi, a mastermind behind the Gulshan caf siege, had been the North Bengal chief of Neo JMB until his arrest at Tangail on January 13 last year.

He was killed in a shootout with police in Bogra's Sherpur on August 29 last year, said the SP.

Tamim, a mastermind of the Gulshan caf attack, was killed during a raid on a Narayanganj house in August last year.

He frequented the JMB den at a house in Juanpur Kuthibari village in Bogra's Sherpur upazila.

Gulshan caf attack mastermind Jahangir Alam alias Rajib Gandhi adorned the post until his arrest at Tangail on January 13, 2016, while Khaled Hasan alias Badar Mama, 30, led from the post until his death in shootout with police in Sherpur of Bogra on August 29, 2016.

Amijul's father Durul Huda, a mason from Godagari's Sarangpur village, married her when she was 12.

According to Laili, Amijul passed Dakhil exams from Norendrapur Dakhil Madrasa in 2008 and completed HSC in 2010 and degree (pass) course in 2013 from Godagari Degree College.

2 JMB militants held in Narayanganj
Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) today claimed to have arrested two members of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in Siddhirganj upazila of Narayanganj.

The detainees are Abdur Rahman alias Sohel, 25, and Faysal Ahmed, 44, of Comilla, our local correspondent reports quoting handout of Rab-11.

Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury was killed in a police raid in Narayanganj on August 27.

He was a key �Neo JMB� leader and one of the masterminds of the Gulshan caf� and Sholakia attacks.

Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), the banned militant outfit, issued a statement around two months back announcing Salauddin Ahmed alias Salehin as its ameer, said Monirul Islam, counterterrorism chief of DMP, yesterday.

The disclosure comes months after a JMB offshoot, �Neo JMB� as law enforcers call it, reportedly carried out two deadly terror attacks in Gulshan and Sholakia.

On February 23, 2014, Salehin and two other top militants -- Rakib Hasan Russell alias Hafez Mahmud and Jahidul Islam alias "Boma" Mizan -- were snatched away in a prison van ambush by militants in Trishal upazila of Mymensingh.

Salehin, who law enforcers believe used to shuttle between India and Bangladesh, narrowly escaped arrest when Kolkata police in a drive at a JMB hideout at bordering Bangaon in West Bengal arrested Trishal attack mastermind Anwar Hossain Faruq on September 25 this year.

Salehin, sentenced to death over the killing of a Christian youth in Jamalpur, was Sylhet-Mymensingh regional chief of JMB.

Law enforcers believe �Boma� Mizan, an explosives expert, is also hiding in India.

Hafez Mahmud, Khulna divisional commander of JMB and condemned to death, has been killed in an operation.

He referred to a recent robbery in Narsingdi following which four suspected JMB men were caught.

Asked about the strength of the mainstream JMB, Monirul Islam said the banned group still has a good number of activists in Jamalpur, Mymensingh, Tangail and North Bengal region -- the areas known to be JMB strongholds.

It, however, grabbed the limelight in April 2004 when it started vigilante operations against the ultra-left outlaws, popularly known as Sarbaharas, in Rajshahi, Natore, Naogaon and Bogra.

Investigators say the �Neo JMB�, which is inspired by IS ideologies, was responsible for the July 1 Gulshan caf� siege in which 20 hostages, including 17 foreigners, were killed.

They were arrested while conducting drives in the capital's Kafrul and Mirpur based on tip-offs, said Rab Additional Director General (operations) Col Anwar Latif Khan.

According to Rab, Sarwar Jahan, who jumped to his death while trying to flee from a building during a Rab raid in Ashulia on October 8, is the chief of "Neo JMB", an offshoot of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).

However, Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit says he is a third-tier leader of "Neo JMB".

They also say that Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury is the chief coordinator of the outfit and mastermind of the July 1 Gulshan attack, in which 20 hostages, 17 of them foreigners, were killed.

Graduating in 2012 from the electrical and electronic engineering department of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), he had joined a telecommunications company, he added.

A relative of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, Bangladesh (Huji-B) chief Mufti Abdul Hannan, Saleh joined the �Sarwar-Tamim group� through Oliuzzaman and used to collect funds from the members upon Oliuzzaman's instructions, claimed Col Anwar.

He took training in operating firearms in Chittagong a year back, he added.

He inspired Mohsin into joining the group and the latter, getting his firearms training in Chittagong in mid-2016, used to mainly motivate people into militancy by giving wrong interpretations of Islam, said the official.

2 top 'Neo JMB' men in India
Two top �Neo JMB� leaders, who were involved in the killing of Prof Rezaul Karim Siddiquee, went to India months before the Gulshan caf� siege possibly to ensure supply of firearms for the terror attack, police say.

Mamunur Rashid Ripon alias Jahangir and Shariful Islam Khaled left for India in April, days after the murder of the Rajshahi University professor.

�We suspect they went to India probably to ensure supply of firearms used in the Gulshan attack,� said a top official of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit of the DMP, wishing anonymity.

�We have also come to know the address of the Kolkata hotel where they boarded after going to India.

�Neo JMB� coordinator Tamim was killed along with his two accomplices in an operation at a militant den in Narayanganj on Saturday.

He was thought to be the Gulshan attack mastermind.

Khaled, who studied in English department of Rajshahi University, coordinated the April 23 attack in which Prof Rezaul Karim was hacked to death, police say.

Recently, three officials from CTTC and the police headquarters visited India and interrogated Islamic State operative Abu Al-Musa Al-Bangali, arrested in India recently.

After the July 1 attack at Holey Artisan Bakery in Gulshan, law enforcers recovered three AK-22 semiautomatic rifles, seven AK-22 magazines and 79 of its bullets.

Investigators said the AK-22s were first smuggled to Nepal from where those were carried to India before reaching to Dhaka through Chapainawabganj border.

Besides, the pistols were smuggled from Munger district of Bihar in India through the same border.

He also said they have so far identified around 10 people who played direct or indirect roles in carrying the firearms and explosives materials from Chapainawabganj to Dhaka.

On the night of July 1, militants seized the cafe, frequented by foreigners, and killed 20 hostages, including nine Italian, seven Japanese and one Indian citizen.

He trained �Neo JMB� operatives for different attacks at a Char in Gaibandha.

Police are also looking for four other operatives -- Jahangir Alam alias Rajiv Gandhi, 27, Manik, Chocolate and Chittagong University student Nurul Islam Marzan.

�We'll appeal to a Dhaka court tomorrow [today] for permission to send Tamim's DNA sample to Canadian authorities to scientifically confirm his identity,� a top official of CTTC told The Daily Star yesterday.

After coming to Bangladesh in 2013, Tamim met Mawlana Abul Quasem, who has been the acting ameer of banned JMB since the arrest of Saidur Rahman.

Quasem, known to the outfit members as �Boro Hujur�, was a teacher at Okhrabari Madrasa in Dinajpur.

Born-again JMB far more dangerous
Banned in 2005 and subsequently broken down, the Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) took only nine years to reorganise.

Investigators say the Neo JMB is responsible for the July 1 Gulshan caf� siege in which 20 hostages, including 17 foreigners, were killed.

Law enforcers came to know in details about the Neo JMB's network, strength, funding and weapons after the Gulshan and Sholakia attacks and a raid at its Kalyanpur den.

DMP's counterterrorism unit chief Monirul Islam yesterday said that with several of its activists arrested and killed in Gulshan, Sholakia and in Kalyanpur, the Neo JMB has been weakened.

In the July 1 siege at Holey Artisan Bakery in Gulshan, the militants used eight arms, including three semi-automatic AK 22 rifles.

A semi-automatic sniper rifle was also recovered from a den in Chittagong.

The group started underground activities that year to establish Taliban-like rule through jihad, but it grabbed the limelight in April 2004 when it started vigilante operations against underground communist outlaws, popularly known as Sarbaharas, in Rajshahi, Natore, Naogaon and Bogra.

In the early stage of JMB, Rahman communicated with Syed Abdul Karim alias Tunda, who was accused of masterminding over 40 bombings in India.

Rahman had confessed that Tunda, allegedly a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist, was in Dhaka and stayed in Jatrabari area in 1990s.

Under Tunda's arrangement, Rahman visited Pakistan in 1997 along with Tunda.

After being arrested by Rab in 2006, Rahman told law enforcers, �I had contact with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood when I was in Saudi Arabia.

I expressed my interest in setting up Islamic rule in Bangladesh�Upon my return �through setting up a separate jihadi organisation to usher in Islamic rule.�

In 2002, he went to Pakistan again.

In his statement, Rahman said they also had contact with the UK-based organisation al-Muhajirun, headed by the Syrian-origin British national Omar Bakri.

The organisation had requested JMB to train its members in Bangladesh.

After the August 17 blasts, they reportedly phoned JMB leaders, advising them to attack various foreign diplomatic missions in Dhaka, and the Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) and also to abduct and assault important foreign persons.

The group was then called JMJB (Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh).

Still, in November and December, JMB carried out five suicide attacks in Jhalakathi, Chittagong, Gazipur and Netrakona.

END OF KINGPINS

'Spiritual leader' of 'Neo JMB' arrested
Counterterrorism officials have arrested the alleged spiritual leader of �Neo JMB�, who they think approved the Gulshan caf� attack plot last year.

He was trying to withdraw Tk 15,000 from a bKash account at that time, Monirul Islam, chief of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said at a press conference at the DMP Media Centre yesterday.

However, while being taken to a Dhaka court yesterday morning, Kashem shouted before some photojournalists that he had been detained 10 months ago.

Kashem was the chief of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) for a certain period.

He later formed �Neo JMB� after holding a meeting with Bangladeshi-Canadian Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury and several others at an unknown place in Rajshahi in 2013, said the CTTC unit chief.

Tamim came to Bangladesh on October 5, 2013 and tried to form a militant outfit.

Law enforcers have been claiming that �Neo JMB� is responsible for the recent spate of targeted and terrorist attacks, including the July 1 Gulshan caf� attack and the Sholakia attack last year, and the Hossaini Dalan attack in October 2015.

Global terror outfit Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the bomb attack, but the government has all along denied existence of IS in Bangladesh.

Kashem, former principal of a madrasa in Dinajpur, was one of the eight members of Neo JMB's Majlis-e-Shura, and he used to visit various militant dens.

And they got the addresses of his Kurigram house and his workplace in Dinajpur after the arrest of Jahangir Alam alias Rajib Gandhi on January 14.

Yesterday, a Dhaka Court placed Kashem on a seven-day remand after Inspector Jahangir Alam of the CTTC unit produced him before the court with a 10-day remand prayer.

Kashem was shown arrested in a case filed with Mirpur Police Station over the raid on Kalyanpur militant hideout in July last year.

Kashem moved to Astimer Char of Kurigram's Kodal Kathi union around one and a half years back after he lost his home to river erosion in Vatiar Chor village, said Humayun Kabir, chairman of Kodal Kathi union.

Around 11 months back, Kashem's family members told Humayun that Kashem, who started working at a madrasa in Dinajpur in 2015, went missing in the capital where he came to do a task given by the madrasa.

Talking to The Daily Star over the phone, Abdul Hamid, founder of Okrabari Hamidia Islamia Orphanage and Madrasa in Dinajpur's Chirir Bandar, said Kashem was appointed madrasa principal in 2015 but he suddenly disappeared at the end of February last year.

'Gunfights': 'Neo JMB' man among 3 killed
Three alleged criminals were killed and two others injured in �gunfights� with police in Bogra, Dhaka and Cox's Bazar yesterday.

The man who was killed in Bogra was a "leader of militant group Neo JMB," and "a close aide" of Gulshan caf� attack mastermind Jahangir alias Rajib Gandhi, who was arrested by police in Tangail, reports our Bogra correspondent, quoting police.

"Neo JMB" is an offshoot of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).

The dead, Abu Musa alias Abujar alias Abu Talha alias Samiul, 32, was the chief of Pabna, Kushtia, Natore and Sirajganj region of "Neo JMB".

Musa also stood accused in cases filed in connection with killing homeopath Mir Sanaullah in Kushtia Sadar upazila and shopkeeper Shunil Gomez at Bonpara Bazaar in Natore, police said.

Nur-e-Alam Siddiki, officer-in-charge of Kahaloo Police Station, said some criminals suddenly opened fire targeting their van when they reached Patonja village around 2:45am yesterday.

�Neo JMB' Leader Jahangir: �He led many killing missions in North'
�Neo JMB� leader Jahangir Alam, who was one of the masterminds behind the Gulshan caf� attack, was also the chief of the killing squad with expertise in using sharp weapons and hacking people to death.

Nazrul, a shura member of mainstream Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), was killed in Gaibandha following a row over the leadership of the banned militant outfit, they said.

Arrested on Friday night in Tangail, Jahangir is now being interrogated by CTTC officials during an eight-day remand.

One of the �Neo JMB� spiritual leaders, Maulana Abul Kashem, teacher of a madrasa in Joypurhat, played a key role in introducing Jahangir to Tamim.

However, Monirul Islam, chief of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, yesterday said they were still trying to identify and arrest Kashem.

�Jahangir is also a member of the four-member board of Neo JMB, which makes decision on who is going kill whom in northern Bangladesh,� a high official of the CTTC unit told The Daily Star yesterday.

Because of Jahangir's expertise in recruiting members and targeted killings, Tamim appointed Jahangir as operational commander to carry out attacks on police in early July, days after the Gulshan caf� attack in which 20 hostages, mostly foreigners, were killed.

Monirul earlier said Jahangir was wanted in 22 militant attack cases which happened in northern Bangladesh.

High-level leaders Ripon and Khaled are believed to have fled to India and Sohel Mahfuz is believed to be in hiding somewhere in Bangladesh, said the official.

She mentioned that Jahid informed her that he had joined �Neo JMB� activities when he had contact with Nayan, who has a PhD in chemistry from Canada.

Gulshan Caf� Attack: 'Neo-JMB leader who supplied arms' arrested
Counterterrorism officials yesterday claimed to have arrested an upazila unit �Neo JMB� commander who leads a syndicate that supplied ingredients for grenades and arms used in the Gulshan attack from the Indian border area near Chapainawabganj.

A team of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested Mizanur Rahman alias Boro Mizan, 60, in-charge of bordering Shibganj upazila unit of �Neo JMB� in a bus near Kakoli crossing in the capital around 10:00pm on Tuesday.

�We intercepted a bus following information that Boro Mizan was coming to Dhaka and arrested him,� said CTTC Assistant Commissioner Ahmedul Islam who led the raid.

Apart from Gulshan attack, the gang ensured ingredients for improvised grenades that were used in all attacks perpetrated by �Neo JMB� in recent years, counterterrorism officials said.

Son of an ex-army official, Galib reportedly launched activities of the outfit in Bangladesh.

On November 2 last year, the CTTC unit arrested four suspected �Neo JMB� operatives, also members of the syndicate, in the capital's Darus Salam area.

Police then claimed the arrestees had admitted that Chhoto Mizan delivered raw materials and firearms, including pistols, to Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury and Nurul Islam Marzan, the key planners of the July 1 attack on the Gulshan eatery.

Officials say the arms and other materials came to Dhaka in baskets of mangoes and other seasonal fruits.

On the night of July 1, militants seized the Gulshan caf� and killed 20 hostages, including nine Italian, seven Japanese and one Indian citizen.

The authorities maintain that �Neo JMB�, an offshoot of the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), carried out the attack.

Fighting religious terrorism in Bangladesh
Terrorism has been now labeled as the systematic internal or external violence and intimidation practiced by organised terrorists.

Considering the concepts of four waves of terrorism given by David Rapoport in 2002 it is found that the fourth wave which is called religious wave began in 1979 the year of Islamic revolution in Iran.

The wave continues with some international political happenings like Afghanistan war with Russia, Middle East crisis, Kashmir crisis, Iraq invasion by US and lastly Syria crisis.

Matching those propositions it can be said that in Bangladesh these factors were responsible for such terrorist attacks.

Response to those, the government of Bangladesh has enacted the Anti-terrorism Act 2009 to combat terrorism that covers terrorism including religious extremism.

Section 6 holds that any person, entity or foreigner may be punished with death or imprisonment for life and in addition to that a fine may also be imposed if he commits offence for the purposes of threatening the unity, integration, public security or sovereignty of Bangladesh.

Countering terrorism in Bangladesh
Politicians and law-enforcers in Bangladesh, from time to time, hype up both panic and complacency by publicizing the following: terrorists everywhere or no terrorists anywhere, in the country.

The ambivalence is counterproductive to counterterrorism (CT) operation.

The first and foremost requirement for effective CT is understanding of terrorism per se, that terrorists are not mindless robots programmed to kill innocent people just for the sake of killing.

I give the example of the ten-year-old American boy, who seconds after the second plane had hit the Twin Towers on 9/11 screamed: Why are they killing us?

What this little boy understood that terrorists don't attack just for the sake of attacking, the American Administration refuses to admit that terrorist attacks are either retaliatory or preemptive by nature.

Any denial is costly, and counterproductive to effective CT operation.

CT experts in Bangladesh must understand the problem of terrorism has deeper roots than alienation of some rich kids.

In the wake of the latest terror attacks at Gulshan and Sholakia, the question is, are Bangladeshi leaders and law-enforcers still going to be in the denial mode?

The stance that there is no ISIS in Bangladesh and that terrorists here are all homegrown locals seems to have become irrelevant.

They should understand terrorism is also globalised like the McDonald's franchise; you don't need American chefs to prepare their burgers in distant Bangladesh.

An effective CT doesn't require more troops or policemen, it requires: a) the admission by politicians and police that terrorists do exist in Bangladesh; b) no bragging about actual or elusive success in CT operation; c) no blame game against each other; and d) good governance and fair distribution of prosperity and opportunities to all.

Interestingly, only 19 terrorists destroyed the Twin Towers on 9/11, killed around 3,000 people, inflicting a loss of more than a trillion dollars to American economy; and al Qaeda spent less than $500,000 for the attacks.

Global CT operators have learnt that there are three different types of politically inspired violence: a) terrorism b) insurgency and c) insurgent-terrorism.

As terrorism is often part of broader insurgencies  the terrorist JMB in Bangladesh is a surrogate to the global insurgency called ISIS  CT operators must apply counterinsurgency (COIN) methods as well.

David Galula, the guru of COIN operators in the world (although this French expert came from the losing side of the War in Algeria), believes CT-COIN is eighty percent political, and twenty percent military.

CT-COIN operators in Bangladesh must apply the concerted civil, military, paramilitary, political, economic, and psychological forces to counter terrorism.

However, this information is a bitter pill to swallow for most government agencies in Bangladesh, and elsewhere.

To conclude, Bangladesh should use the globally recognised CT-COIN Manual, for example the one developed by the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS), which is all about intrastate and interstate cooperation to contain and defeat terrorist-insurgencies in various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Bangladesh.

CT-COIN operators in Bangladesh should learn, there's no substitute for good governance, which is transparent and accountable, and ensures democracy, the freedom of expression, human rights and dignity.

Terrorists in Bangladesh
LOCALS and foreigners in Dhaka formally grieved for the victims of the Gulshan Attack one month after the incident.

The local and international reaction to the July 1 terror attack at Gulshan has been far more intensive than the collective reaction to all the previous terror attacks in Bangladesh since 1999; there had never been any such mass grieving for terrorism-victims previously.

Now, why was the Gulshan caf� attack so significant?

Because, it was for the first time, terrorists attacked the heart of the elite enclave and diplomatic zone in Bangladesh, killing 17 foreigners and three well-to-do Bangladeshis.

In the backdrop of fear, conspiracy theories, and singling out private universities as �new madrasas�, Bangladeshi politicians, analysts, and intellectuals are surprised, secular-educated, rich urban youths, not poor, madrasa-educated students took part in the Gulshan attack.



The US-sponsored �jihad� for Afghanistan, and the Pakistan-sponsored �jihad� for Kashmir, and their promotion of Islamist extremism through mosques and madrasas turned these places into the epicentres of Islamist terrorism.

Faction-ridden Muslim clerics in Bangladesh often vilify each other as deviant, and even as promoters of terrorism.

Recently, Maulana Fariduddin Maswood � the imam of the Sholakia Eidgah and the Chief of the Bangladesh Jamiat-ul-Ulama � publicly stated in Dhaka that books prescribed by the Bangladesh Madrasa Board promoted Islamist extremism.

To him, the Education Minister's alleged oversight virtually amounted to promoting jihad in Bangladesh.

As the ongoing Arabisation-cum-Wahhabisation process has alienated people from secularism and democracy, so have massive corruption and impunity of the rich and powerful estranged many from the state of Bangladesh.

Illegitimate rulers like General Ershad were mainly responsible for legitimising political Islam in Bangladesh.

Now, we need convincing answers to the question: Why have urban rich kids, not poor students, swelled the ranks of ISIS in Bangladesh?

The Prime Minister's Information Advisor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury candidly admitted the government and experts had simply failed to understand the problem by only finger pointing at mosques and madrasas as the promoters of terrorism in Bangladesh.

This episode being a microcosmic representation of Bangladesh provides part of the answer to his question too.

Bangladesh is virtually a safe haven for corrupt people.

The growing youth bulge � more than 40 percent of the population is in the18 to 39-year-old age group � and the widening gap between the rich and poor, with massive 45 percent unemployment among educated youths, Bangladesh has a potential of being a fertile breeding ground for terrorism and anarchy.

According to UNICEF, 7.4 million children aged between five and 17 are working as domestic servants, agricultural and factory labourers in Bangladesh.

Although there is no positive correlation between terrorism and mosque-madrasa establishments, yet the government has started preparing a standardised Khutba or Friday prayer sermon through the Islamic Foundation for all mosques in Bangladesh to prevent the spread of any terrorist ideas through unapproved sermons.

The poor, marginalised, and uninformed madrasa students in Bangladesh are too weak and disorganised to spearhead any violent or revolutionary movement.

This explains why urban, rich, and secular-educated � not rural, poor, and madrasa-educated � youths appear so far to be the main foot soldiers of Islamist terror in Bangladesh.

Two cattle thieves die in mob beating
Two cattle thieves were lynched by angry mob at Madhupur in Tangail in the early hours of yesterday.

On information, Madhupur police rushed to the spot, recovered the bodies and sent them to Tangail General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

ANM Golam Mostofa, officer-in-charge (OC) of Madhupur Police Station, told The Daily Star that Ainal and Ripon were professional cattle thieves.

"Madhupur police had arrested them with four stolen cows on April 22 but they were released on bail recently," he added.

Farmers of Dahagram-Angorpota in Patgram upazila have no free access to take their cattle through the Tinbigha corridor to mainland markets while certificates are allegedly being issued to the smugglers to sell cows.

Shahedul Islam of Mahimpur village said he owns eight cows, but cannot sell them in the mainland markets without permission of UP representatives and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB).

He said they purchase a cow for Tk 10,000 to Tk 20,000 in the Indian markets and sell those for Tk 45,000 to Tk 65,000 in the Bangladesh markets.

Nayek Shamsul said the BGB and India's Border Security Force jointly decided that 60 cows would be allowed from Dahagram to the mainland markets through the Tinbigha corridor a week with a view to checking cattle smuggling.

Rawhide being smuggled to India with impunity
Speakers at a seminar in Rajshahi yesterday expressed concern over "unabated smuggling" of rawhides to India through different borders in northwestern region of Bangladesh.

Although a huge number of rawhides are being smuggled to India every day, the country's law enforcers are not playing active role to stop it, they said.

Bangladesh Finished Leather, Leathergoods and Footwear Exporters Association and Leather Sector Business Promotion Council jointly organised the seminar styled "Awareness building against smuggling of rawhides" at Safawang Community Centre in the city.

With the association's adviser Dil Jahan Bhuiyan in the chair, Rajshahi City Corporation Mayor AHM Khairuzzaman Liton, as chief gust; the association's Rajshahi unit President Ataur Rahman, Rajshahi District Hide Traders Group President Lutfar Rahman, and Natore District Hide Traders Association General Secretary Lutfar Rahman, among others, attended the programme.

Arms control in Bangladesh and the UN arms trade treaty, will it benefit us?

According to Oxfam again, more than US$ 2.2 billion worth of arms and ammunitions have been exported between 2000-2010 to countries subject to multilateral (UN) arms embargoes including Iran and North Korea.

In 1995, the Arias Foundation of Costa Rica in collaboration with other NGOs drafted �the International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers� as a proposal for a legally binding instrument.

Encouraged by the success of the international campaign to ban landmines, in 1997, Costa Rican President Dr. Oscar Arias called upon a group of fellow Nobel Peace Laureates -- Alolfor Perez Esquivel, Aung San Suu Kyi, Betty Williams, Elie Wiesel, Jimmy Carter, Jody Williams, Jose Ramos-Horta, Desmond Tutu, Rigoberta Menchu etc., -- to promote the code and, by 2000, this International Code was transformed with the assistance of lawyers from Cambridge University and Amnesty International into a more refined proposal i.e., the Draft Framework Convention on International Arms Transfers.

It was first circulated at the 2001

UN SALW Conference

In September 2004, the UK became the first permanent member of the UN Security Council to back the initiative.

But it was on July 24, 2006 that the governments of Argentina, Australia, Costa Rica, Finland, Japan, Kenya, and the UK circulated the draft 'Towards an Arms Trade Treaty' resolution among the members of the UNGA First Committee.

The resolution was adopted on October 26, 2006, and voted on December 6, of the same year with 153 votes casted in favour, 24 governments abstained, and only the United States voted against the resolution.

The positive impetus provided by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by announcing US' support in favour of the ATT led to the immediate adoption of the UN Resolution 64/48 in 2009.

Arms Control in Bangladesh and the UN ATT

Arms control efforts in Bangladesh have been dismal and the record shows lax initiatives by the government agencies as well as by the NGOs both local and international, and even by the civil society.

Despite not being affected by any major conflict, Bangladesh has a significant small arms proliferation problem.

Therefore, it is important to probe into the relevance of the ATT for Bangladesh.

What are the benefits of the treaty for Bangladesh?

What is so far and what should be Bangladesh's position on the ATT?

Will the treaty create new challenges for Bangladesh?

The foremost benefits for Bangladesh from the ATT emanate from the fact that the treaty will strengthen various efforts to control and curb small arms proliferation and related atrocities in Bangladesh.

Key sources of illegal SALW in Bangladesh are perceived to be those trafficked or smuggled into Bangladesh, and weapons that are leaking from state stocks.

Small arms are used extensively both by petty criminals and organised syndicates in various criminal activities in Bangladesh viz., extortions, robbing, kidnapping etc., often resulting in human casualties.

A distinguishing feature of small arms proliferation, armed violence, and criminal activities in Bangladesh are their linkages with the politics of the country.

Very often, after hartalday, images of political activists carrying guns and pistols are often seen in the first pages of the newspapers revealing the impact of easy availability of small arms in the politics of Bangladesh.

Bangladesh for some time has also been a key 'transit route' for trafficking and smuggling of weapons in South Asia.

The Chittagong and the Khulna sea ports are also used as transit routes for arms smuggling.

The 2004 Chittagong arms haul case is a crucial example of Bangladesh being used as a transit country.

Small arms and ammunitions have also been used by the extremist groups in Bangladesh especially by the leftist and the religious extremists.

There have been some horrifying instances of use of small arms viz., grenades, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in many cases in Bangladesh.

The most devastating incident occurred on 21 August 2004, when a grenade attack was perpetrated by the religious extremist outfit Harkat-ul Jihad al Islami Bangladesh (HUJIB) targeting the present-day Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, while she was delivering a speech in a rally, killing 23 people including the Awami League Women's Affairs Secretary Ivy Rahman.

Although the government has been immensely successful in countering extremism in Bangladesh, lack of international arms transfer standards leaves scope for arming these various non-state actors by external entities both state and non-state in nature.

Therefore, considering the challenges posed by the unabated proliferation of SALW, an international arms trade treaty is expected to deliver handful benefits to Bangladesh.

An ATT will help Bangladesh: (a) to address the serious issue of illicit arms trade in the country; (b) to counter illicit arms trafficking by putting an end to utilising Bangladesh as a transit state; (c) by ending or at least limiting arms transfers to the few extremist groups in the country that are still functional; (d) in ensuring transparency in its own international arms trade though Bangladesh remains a small trader; and (e) in eradicating leakages in the system, therefore, making serious contribution in Bangladesh's socio-political development as well as enhancing its overall security situation.

Bangladesh, therefore, has rightly expressed its position in favour of a comprehensive, legally binding ATT.

Bangladesh, while supporting the decision-making process on the 'basis of consensus', proposes observance of alternatives in case of absence of 'universal consensus'.

Bangladesh upholds the view that one or two member states should not be allowed to derail or undermine many years of good work by the international community.

Bangladesh also strongly supported that the scope of the treaty should be comprehensive enough to cover all sorts of transfers -- export, import, state-to-state, state-to-private end-user, commercial sales, leases, loans or gifts or any other form of transfers of material goods or expertise, re-export, transit, temporary transfer and trans-shipment and brokerage of all conventional arms, including heavy weapons, SALW, ammunitions, parts and components etc.

However, the scope should also be feasible for implementation and Bangladesh proposed for a regular updating of items to be covered by the treaty.

New opportunities, newer challenges

Just like the flip side of the coin, while the prospects of an ATT offer great opportunities for a country like Bangladesh, the very fact of implementing the treaty might create new challenges for the country.

Two major implementation aspects of the treaty as elaborated in Articles 5 and 10 of the proposed draft involving national legislation requirements and reporting commitments pose significant challenges for Bangladesh.

This provision of the draft clearly shows that the ATT will put Bangladesh like all other states under obligation to take all the necessary legislative and administrative measures to implement the treaty provisions.

This obligation of instituting national control system will definitely require Bangladesh to adopt new national legislations, which will put Bangladesh under strains given the country's technical and financial capability and constraints.

For a developing country like Bangladesh meeting this 'necessary legislative and administrative measures' will, therefore, be a crucial challenge.

The record-keeping and reporting requirement of states as elaborated in Article 10 of the draft treaty is another aspect of implementation challenges for Bangladesh.

For resource-constraint developing country like Bangladesh, this provision would place additional responsibilities such as instituting one or more national contact points to exchange information with the ATT secretariat and an operational responsibility for inter-agency coordination and cooperation at the national level, upon the overstressed, dysfunctional, and more importantly poorly resourced state machinery.

Being a developing country with funding constraints, reporting mechanism under the ATT would not only be difficult for Bangladesh but to some extent the country may not be able to fulfil this requirement without international assistance.

However, as advocated by Bangladesh, the assistance and the funding provisions of the ATT should be made binding.

In fact, Bangladesh needs to continue its effort to push for these assistance and funding provisions to be binding and take the leadership as a stalwart of LDC countries, as Bangladesh has had done in many other UN negotiations viz., climate change negotiations.

Smugglers pouring in garments, cosmetics ahead of festivals




Huge amounts of goods are being smuggled in daily through direct passenger buses and trains running on Dhaka-Kolkata-Dhaka route as a section of passport passengers known as 'luggage party' are pouring in different types of garments and cosmetics from India ahead of the Eid and Puja festivals.

Smugglers' syndicates of the two countries are using the buses and trains as a 'safer medium' for bringing Indian goods to supply it to the local market.

Valuables including gold and US dollars are also allegedly smuggled using these transports.

On August 4, Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) seized Indian sari worth Tk 36 lakh from a bus of transport company 'Souhardo Paribahan' running on Dhaka-Kolkata route.

On August 8, law enforcers seized 59 bags containing Indian saris and three pieces of lehenga, worth about Tk one crore, from another bus of the same company.

At Dhaka Cantonment station on August 12, Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) raided Moitree Express train coming from India through Darshana border and recovered high quality Indian saris, 'three pieces' and other garments worth about Tk 3 crore.

As goods worth crores of taka enter Bangladesh through illegal ways, the import through land ports sees a decline, depriving the government of huge revenue, officials said.

Although Customs and BDR conduct joint raids on the buses, they rarely check the baggage of the 'luggage party' passengers," said a Bangladeshi passenger travelling in a bus of Souhardo Paribahan.

In Chittagong, police seized Indian garments worth Tk 10 lakh and arrested one person yesterday from the city's Mansurabad area under Double-Mooring police station.



"We seized 647 pieces of Indian salwar kamiz and 552 pieces of Indian saris worth Tk 10 lakh from the truck," Tanvir said.

Meanwhile, members of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) on Sunday noon recovered smuggled Indian cloths worth Tk 20 lakh from Kali Bazar area in Dharmoghor of Habiganj district.

Acting on a tip-off, a team of BDR raided the area and recovered 360 pieces Indian saris and 30 three-piece sets which were hidden under a pile of straw.

Children used in smuggling

Talking to this correspondent at Sree Rampur border in Patgram upazila, local cattle trader Mojibul Islam said at least Tk 300 is needed to hire an adult for transporting a pair of cows from no-man's land to a nearby cattle market.

"At least 500 Indian cattle traders are active in 22 border points of the district and they employ school children for smuggling cattle," said another cattle trader Noor Muhammad.

A school teacher at Islampur border village in the upazila wishing anonymity said BGM men allow the traders to continue the smuggling in exchange for money.

Indian traders gather their cattle at unauthorised markets at no-man's land area and Bangladeshi traders use these children to bring the cattle to local market, he said.

Shariful Islam, a class IV student of a local primary school at Burimari border point in Patgram, said at least 30 children of his school were involved in transporting smuggled cattle twice a week.

Delowar Hossain, a primary schoolteacher at Islampur, said some students of classes III, IV and V remain absent in their classes twice a week.

Contacted, Lt Col Shafiul Alam Khan, commanding officer of Lalmonirhat 15 BGB Battalion, said yesterday he recently issued orders for BGB patrols for increased vigilance in border areas.

"The smugglers holed up in and outside the country after the reinvestigation of many cases like the Chittagong arms haul, August 21 grenade attack and SAMS Kibria murder cases," she told the journalists.

Asked whether any steps taken for arrest of the terrorists hiding in India, the minister said the government would take all-out steps to rein them in.

Since 2010, seven attempts including yesterday's to smuggle wildlife have been foiled by the customs and immigration officials of Dhaka airport and destination airports including Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.

Of the turtles, 300 were rare Indian star tortoises, 90 three-keeled turtles and 25 were Indian roofed turtles, the forest official said.

Indian star turtles are very popular as exotic pets in gardens.

All these species are available in Bangladesh and India.

Beside the Indian star tortoise, there were six other species of turtles; they are black turtle, tricarinate hill turtle, spotted pond turtle, crowned turtle, Sylheti roofed turtle and brown roofed turtle, he told The Daily Star via email yesterday.

Goa opens smuggling museum




The long beaches and rocky inlets of western India have been a haven for contraband for centuries, with smugglers sneaking their goods into the country via the Arabian Sea.

Now a new museum has opened to tell the story of India's smuggling history, displaying the unusual items uncovered by keen-eyed customs officials and the elaborate lengths smugglers went to in an effort to conceal their activities.

The Indian Customs and Central Excise Museum, created at a reported cost of about 600,000 dollars, is housed in a heritage building on the banks of the river Mandovi in the Goa state capital Panaji.

The building, painted in indigo blue after the dye traded in Portuguese colonial times, is thought to have been built in 1600 and served as the headquarters for customs operations from 1834 to the turn of the 21st century.

Lillian Fernandes, the officer in charge of the museum, said collecting the exhibits has been a labour of love, with workers scanning through huge lists of seized goods from across India and then battling through red tape.

Detectives say transnational syndicates are using Bangladesh as a route to smuggle gold into India.

Almost every week in the past two years, customs officials seized smuggled gold at Dhaka and Chittagong airports.

In the last one year, customs officials in Dhaka filed around 30 departmental cases over the recovery of about 100kg gold, said Joint Commissioner of Customs Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin.

In Chittagong, customs officials seized 268kg gold in the first seven months of last year in 136 incidents, over which the department filed 14 police cases against 122 departmental ones.

I was posted at the [Dhaka] airport customs six months ago, I got no reward."

India does not export cattle to Bangladesh, yet thousands of them have been making their way into Bangladesh through different recognised corridors.

Rather, Indian cattle can be accused of trespassing!

In most cases, the stories seem to be identical: Indian cattle enter Bangladesh as if by mistake.

Traders on this side of the border gather those stray animals and pay a �fine� to Bangladesh authorities to get a �pass� for taking them elsewhere in the country.

According to data of Bangladesh customs, a total of 21,06,157 cattle, including cow, buffalo and goat, entered the country through different recognised corridors in fiscal 2013-14.

And Bangladesh authorities, through the customs offices in Rajshahi, Chittagong, Khulna, Jessore, Rangpur and Sylhet, collected Tk 10.53 crore in �fine� on those animals.

Talking to The Daily Star, Tariqul Islam, a cattle trader from Chapainawabganj, said the flow of cattle from India dropped significantly due to Delhi's recent move to stop cattle smuggling.

Mostly, cattle from Murshidabad enter Chapainawabganj through two corridors -- one in Shibganj upazila and the other in Bholahat upazila.

Another cattle trader from Navaron in Jessore said there are people who receive cattle from the Indian side, bring them to Bangladesh territory and directly take them to the cattle shed called �Khatal�.

Previously, cattle traders used to pay Tk 700 per cow to the persons who brought them into Bangladesh from the Indian side.

However, the rate has now increased to Tk 1,000 per cow after the Indian authorities imposed the restriction, he added.

�We have already ordered the law enforcement agencies to take strong steps to stop smuggling of the illegal arms,� she said while addressing the inauguration of an eye camp at Uttara in the city.

Smuggling of huge Indian drugs through the border in Lalmonirhat district has continued, despite recurring drives with redrawn strategies by different law enforcement agencies especially Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB).

Authorities destroyed huge drugs worth about Tk 1 crore 9 lakh on the premises of Lalmonirhat Government College in the town yesterday.

The drugs including 4,289 bottles of wine, 7,772 bottles of phensidyl and 3,083 kg of hemp worth about Tk 1 crore 9 lakh were seized in border areas of Lalmonirhat at different times.

Marking International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking yesterday, the district administration and the Narcotics Control Department jointly arranged a procession in the town and later a discussion held in the hall room of Lalmonirhat Government College.

Border areas of Durgapur in Aditmari upazila and Mogholhat in Sadar upazila are serving as safe zones for drug smugglers, locals said.

Smugglers usually prefer the routes in different border areas of Lalmonirhat as a few rivers there make the task easy, said narcotics officials.

Seeking anonymity, BGB officials said a large number of factories in Indian territories along India-Bangladesh border produce huge phensidyl and supply it to Bangladesh.

During talks with their Indian counterparts, Bangladesh authorities on several occasions handed over to them lists of such phensidyl factories with request to destroy them.

Admitting rampant drug smuggling from India, Subedar Nurul Islam, commander of Durgapur BGB camp in Aditmari upazila, said proper patrolling in the entire border area is not possible due to shortage of manpower.

Drug smuggling rampant thru' C'nawabganj border
Chapainawabganj border has become a safe route for drug smuggling and their dispatch to Dhaka and other areas of the country.

An organised gang of smugglers, mostly from Alatuli and Shahjahanpur unions of Sadar upazila, dispatch the drugs via Godagari of Rajshahi to other places of the country, said sources in the area.

Twenty-two kg of heroin, 6.3 kg of cocaine, 29 kg of hemp, 21,579 bottles of phensidyl were recovered in the area in last six months, said sources of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and Narcotics Control Department.

In the biggest haul in recent times, BDR recovered 7.5 kg heroin and 100 gram cocaine on May 4 from smugglers at Hakimpur village in Sadar upazila, BDR sources said.

150kg heroin couriered to UK in 12 years




Bangladeshi members of a transnational drug cartel smuggled around 150 kilograms of heroin to the UK through Bangladesh in the last 12 years, taking advantage of the lax security checking system of some courier services.

At least 10 local gangs have couriered the deadly drug in around 250 consignments, hiding them in shoes, leatherjackets and books after Pakistani agents had brought them to Bangladesh from Pakistan and Afghanistan, detectives say.

On information from Tuhin that a Bangladeshi-born British citizen named Shah Alam Suman, a Pakistani national and some British nationals had been operating from the UK, Bangladeshi detectives sought help from the International Police (Interpol) to nab the gang.

Deeply concerned, British High Commission officials in Dhaka contacted the DB officials and told them that the British government might as well send a team of its secret service to help investigate the gang's activities here.

"If necessary, British intelligence will work jointly with the Bangladeshi detectives to bust the network," said Mashiur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner of DB.

He added that Immigration Liaison Officer of the High Commission, Shaun Antun, recently met the detectives and talked with those arrested in this connection.

"Upon our request, the High Commission has already given us the passport information of Suman and requested us to share with it information about the local agents of the gang.

"The High Commission authorities are also willing to send their secret service, MI6, to Bangladesh," Mashiur added.

Touhidul Islam, assistant commissioner of DB, said the gang preferred the branches of international courier services in Bangladesh to those in Pakistan, as the branches here lack a rigorous security mechanism.

After his arrest, Tuhin told detectives that Suman used to call him over the phone to give him a code and a location to meet Pakistani agents.

During interrogation, he named a number of the gang members -- Liton of Sunamganj, Ali of Feni and Zakir of Noakhali -- but claimed they all worked separately.

Jitu told the police that he had bought the drug from an employee of Aramex Courier Service in Savar, on the outskirts of the capital.

They told the police that they found the drug in a packet of shoes to be couriered to Suman in the UK.

According to the package seized from Tuhin, Suman's address is 150, Fernley Road, Spark Hill, Birmingham, UK.

Detectives in Dhaka are still awaiting an update from the Interpol.

In the wake of the arrests and the revelation, the international courier services in Bangladesh and the government postal service department last month decided to work together with the police to curb drug trafficking, said Enayet Hossain Khan, financial manager of Aramex Courier Service.

The courier services that operate internationally and have offices in Bangladesh include Aramex, DHL, FedEx, TNT Express and UPS.

Asked about the present status of investigation into the matter in the UK and Suman's whereabouts, a British High Commission spokesperson in Dhaka said in an email, "The UK works with a variety of close international law enforcement partners in the region in order to tackle the threat of drugs to the UK.

It may be mentioned that the UK customs in May 2005 accused five Bangladeshi business firms -- BD Foods Ltd, Emdad Traders, Jamil International, MM Enterprise, and Green Haven Enterprise -- of smuggling 75.5kg of heroin to that country in the name of food, toiletries, cosmetics and tiles.

This was revealed after Premier Bank on Monday informed Bangladesh Bank that fraudsters pocketed around Tk 40 lakh from four of Premier Bank's ATMs by using five cloned credit cards of Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Bank on Saturday and Sunday, according to a top official of Premier Bank.

All those cards were of the clients of Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Bank,� Khandkar Fazle Rashid, managing director of Premier Bank, told The Daily Star.

Earlier, fraudsters captured data of around 1,200 cards used in four ATMs of three banks in Dhaka between February 6 and February 12, according to Bangladesh Bank.

�Data of these cards were skimmed off and cloned in Saudi Arabia and criminals used those to withdraw money from ATMs of Premier Bank here,� Shubhankar Saha, executive director and spokesman of the central bank, told The Daily Star yesterday.

�Of these copied cards, may be, some were used by the Bangladeshi expatriates in Saudi Arabia or Saudi nationals visiting Bangladesh at that time,� said Kazi Saifuddin Munir, managing director of IT Consultants Limited that runs the country's largest payments switch, Q Cash.

The ATM frauds that took place between February 6 and February 12 created a huge hue and cry in the country as such incidents were first of its kind in Bangladesh.

Thomas, also known as, Piotr Szczepan Mazurek, a German national, and his three local partners working in the City Bank were arrested for allegedly skimming ATM cards and stealing cash from cardholders.

Investigators found Thomas was leading a lavish life in Dhaka with the stolen money of the international credit cards used by foreigners.

Gangs, active in Dhaka and other places of the country, maintain a chain among themselves.

Most of those are taken outside Dhaka and then dismantled for selling their parts separately, police said.

Smuggling thru' Rajshahi border points goes up
Smuggling through the Rajshahi border points have increased considerably due to laxness of border guards in the last few days, said people in the bordering villages.

Indian drugs including heroin and phensidyl and clothes are entering the country through the borders in huge quantity, they said.

�One has to cross the Padma River twice to go to the Indian border at Char Majardia.

Similar picture is available also at other Padma ghats toward the Indian borders including Sonaikandi, Khar Chaka, Bidirpur and Char Asariadaha.

Now anxious about their fate after the incident in Dhaka, many of them are staying inside their camps,� a smuggler told this correspondent during the latter's visit to Godagari.

Mansur Ali, a member of Char Asariadaha union parishad, said Indian villagers with the help of Indian BSF members are taking away crops and grass from Bangladesh fields on Manik Chalk border areas.

�Smugglers have no scope to be active as Indian BSF are on high alert following Bangladesh incident�, said a BOP official.

A newspaper informed us last week of an international smuggling network's use of the greater Rangpur as its route for smuggling blood from across the border.

Brought to Bangladesh mostly under cover of icecream boxes these blood bags are then sold to different medical facilities including Rangpur Medical College.

With such an expansive and largely unguarded common border with India, it is impossible to stop smuggling.

Allegation of rawhide smuggling into India through Kurigram
Rawhides collected from sacrificial animals during Eid-ul-Azha are being smuggled to India through Fulbari border in Kurigram because of a fall in the prices of the hides this year than the last year.

With the help of so-called linemen, police and members of Border Guard Bangladesh, seasonal hide traders financed by Indian traders have been smuggling out the hides and skins to India, local people alleged.

A Bangladeshi trader, preferring not to be named, said they are more interested to sell their collected rawhides to the Indian traders as they do not get their expected prices from local tanners.

Drug smuggling rampant thru' C'nawabganj border
Chapainawabganj border has become a safe route for drug smuggling and their dispatch to Dhaka and other areas of the country while the smugglers use poor people, mostly women and children, as low cost carriers.

An organised gang of smugglers, mostly from Alatuli, Shahjahanpur, Charbagdanga unions of Chapainawabganj Sadar upazila, dispatch drugs via Godagari upazila of Rajshahi to different places of the country, said locals and law enforcers.

Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) recovered 5.5 kg of heroin, 500 grams of cocaine, 100 kg of hemp, 2,532 bottles containing 1,658 litres of liquor, 32,879 bottles of phensidyl and 4,795 contraband injections and arrested 169 drug traders in the area in last one year, said sources of BGB Chapainawabganj 39 Battalion.

Heroin traders mostly use bordering Alatuli, Shajahanpur and Charbagdanga unions of Sadar upazila as they are virtually isolated from the district headquarters by the Padma River in absence of any road links.

Phensidyl traders use Monaksha, Binodpur and Shabajpur unions of Shibganj upazila in Chapainawabganj.

BGB members of Diar Manik Char camp arrested Joytsna, a housewife of Diar Manik Char area, and Taskira Khatun, a class eight student of Kodalkati High School in Sadar upazila, and recovered 500 grams of heroin from their possession at Godagari Rail Bazar on October 9 last year.

That time arrested Joytsna and Taskira told this correspondent at BGB Battalion headquarters in Chapainawabganj town that one Saiful Islam of Kodalkati village gave them four packets of heroin to hand it to one Kalu of Mohishalbari under Godagari upazila in Rajshahi.

"Every day 300 to 350 imported goods-laden trucks enter Sonamasjid land port from India.

Smuggling surges
Essential commodities, including edible soybean oil, onion, garlic and rice, are being smuggled into Myanmar through at least 23 border points of Teknaf and Ukhia upazilas in the district, sources concerned said.

In exchange, banned tablet Yaba, narcotics, sexual stimulant and other items are coming into Bangladesh.

The points include Nila, Natmora Para, Chowdhury Para, Leda, Jadimura, Domdomia, Wabrang, Moulvibazar, Hoaikhong, Kanjar Para, Minabazar, Jhimongkhali, Lomba Beel, Ulubonia, Keruntoli, Naitongpara, Kaukhalipara, Jalia Para, Nazir Para, Sabrang, Naya Para, Mistri Para under Teknaf upazila and Palong Khali, Amtoli, Rahmater Beel, Balu Khali, Anjumanpara, Ghumdhum under Ukhia upazila.

The smuggled items include mostly edible palm oil, soybean oil, onion, garlic and rice while 'current' nets, Yaba tablets, pistachios, beer, wine bottles, dried fish, rifles, clothes, lungis, tea leaves, powder milk, sugar and polythene bags and some other items are smuggled in from Myanmar.

Sources said the BDR jawans of Teknaf 42 Rifle Battalion have seized goods worth about Tk 3 crore during this month till August 22.

Deputy Commander of Teknaf 42 Rifles Battalion Major Shahinur Rahman confirmed it and said the jawans have been kept on alert so that edible oil, garlic, rice, fertiliser and other essential commodities can not be smuggled into Myanmar during the month of Ramadan.

Acting Mayor of Teknaf Municipality Md Ismail said during the month of Ramadan the demand for edible oil, diesel, vermilion, oil and other commodities increase in Myanmar state of Arakan.

Bangladeshi smugglers take this opportunity.

As a result, a crisis of these items is created in Teknaf area and prices go up.

Teknaf Upazila Parisad Chairman Md Shafiq Miah said awareness activities are being carried out among the people of the area besides keeping the BDR men on alert to combat the smuggling.

Phensidyl smuggling up on lax border vigilance
Phensidyl smuggling has shot up since the February 25 carnage at Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) headquarters, as lax border control, because of a shortage of BDR guards, allowed smugglers to step up operations across the Indo-Bangladesh border.

In the Dhaka metropolitan sub-region alone, narcotics control department officials said they seized around 7,000 Phensidyl bottles in April, up from only 1,000 in January.

Meanwhile, Phensidyl prices on streets have halved as the price of a bottle of Phensidyl in Dhaka now is at Tk 350 to Tk 400, which was Tk 650 to Tk 700 in early 2009.

A Phensidyl user from Dhaka Medical College Hospital area said Phensidyl traders are calling him repeatedly to sell it at abnormally low prices.

Bangladesh shares nearly 4,000 kilometres or 2,500 miles of land and maritime borders with its neighbours India and Myanmar.

Children used for smuggling as BDR, BSF watchful about adults




Smugglers active in Sadar, Aditmari, Kaliganj, Hatibandha and Patgram upazilas under Lalmonirhat district are using children as carriers as adults now prefer to keep away due to increased vigilance by Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and Indian Border Security Force (BSF).

Using children for smuggling has increased recently as some 10 smugglers' syndicates active in Lalmonirhat district now find the strategy convenient to dodge BDR and BSF who have taken special steps to check cross border movement through 22 routes in Lalmonirhat district.

Smuggling syndicates recruit children to smuggle goods from India, as border guards are not allowing Bangladeshi adults to come closer to the border even during daytime.

During a recent visit to some border areas of Sadar, Aditmari, Kaliganj, Hatibandha and Patgram upazilas in Lalmonirhat, this correspondent found children aged between 10 to 15 years carrying smuggled goods.

Neighbour Dohar Ali gives us Tk 90 regularly for carrying his goods twice a day to and from India,� said Belal, 11, and Rasul, 9, sons of Minhazul at Gobda village near Durgapur border.

They said they do not go far inside India.

�My father ordered me to carry these goods to India.

He gives me Tk 10 per day,� said 13-yearold Jasim, a resident of a bordering village near Durgapur.

So our children are engaged to carry goods,� Jalal Uddin of Durgapur border village said.

A BDR jawan at Durgapur border said, �We hardly suspect children moving around or playing at bordering villages.

Five including three high officials of the national flag carrier -- Biman Bangladesh Airlines � were remanded today hours after detectives arrested them in a major operation to track a gold smuggling syndicate that has been active for quite some time.

In the wake of frequent gold smugglings through Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, Detective Branch of police conducted the drive in the capital�s Uttara and Bashundhara areas and arrested the five last night, said Monirul Islam, joint commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP).

The two other detainees are Mahmudul Haque, contractor of Biman Bangladesh, and Mahammad Harunur Rashid, a money exchange businessman.

Trespass, smuggling, clashes and crimes now order of the day
Indian goods being carried on bicycles through the Bangladesh border in Mogholhat under Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila as several border points in the area now serve as safe routes for smuggling amid lax vigilance by the law enforcers of the two countries.

Border areas of Mogholhat and Durgapur under Lamonirhat district often serve as routes for illegal entry of Indian citizens and smuggling of arms and drugs, thanks to the laxity in vigilance by Border Guard Bangladesh and Indian Border Security Force.

The situation often gives rise to criminal activities, including clashes between Indian intruders and local Bangladeshis.

Several hundred villagers from Indian villages Nagortari, Doribas and Jaridharla under Cooch Behar district in Pashchimbanga regularly come to Mogholhat Bazar, Durgapur Bazar and Durakuti Hat in Bangladesh without visas, locals said.

This has been a practice for long, as there is no marketplace in the three Indian villages and those are separated by the Dharla River from mainland India, they said.

In the last one month, 11 clashes took place near the border inside Bangladesh territory.

In the night of July 21, a group of Indian criminals aided by their Bangladesh associates, attacked two Bangladeshi families, injured nine people and vandalised and looted their five houses.

On July 17, Indian criminals kidnapped Bangladeshi trader Sudhir Chandra on Mogholhat border and he was freed for ransom of Tk one lakh on July 20.

On July 14, Indian smugglers assaulted Bangladeshi citizens Nur Hossain, Azibor Rahman, Shamsul Islam and six others on Mogholhat border, apparently centring smuggling of Indian contraband items, locals said.

�Some Indians, including identified criminals Bhokra Babu, Emdadul, Mazidul, Ayub Ali often threaten Bangladesh people if they protest illegal trade in the border areas,� said Moslem Uddin Sarker, a member of Mogholhat union parishad.

Seeking anonymity, a few personnel of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) at Mogholhat, said they know everything but do not take actions due to pressure from local politicians.

Lt Col Mahbubur Rahman, commanding officer of Lalmonirhat 15 BGB Battalion, said, "Bangladeshis living close to the border should inform the BGB whenever they see Indians inside Bangladesh.

Additional District Magistrate Abu Noor Md Shamsuzzaman said the district administration has already asked BGB in Lalmonirhat to stop illegal entry of the Indians.

Kamal Uddin Ahmed, additional home secretary, said, "We have no reports of any criminal incidents or illegal entry of the Indians into Bangladesh through the Lalmonirhat border.

Smuggled Indian cattle flood Lalmonirhat markets
Indian cattle smuggled from India have flooded local markets in the district while border guards claim that no cattle have been smuggled from India during the last three months.

The customs authority is not collecting revenue through corridor slip (token given to the people who bring the cattle from across the border) as Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has stopped giving token for collecting revenue from smuggled Indian cattle for the last three months, said Shamsul Ferdous, customs inspector of Islampur Corridor at Patgarm upazila.

Cattle smuggling from India has decreased at least by 50 percent as BGB does not give corridor slip, said cattle trader Mozharul Islam, 45, of Dahagram village, adding that some members of the syndicate are still smuggling cattle.

Komiz Uddin, 48, an alleged lineman to BGB at Sreerampur village, said Patgram market is the district's biggest cattle market.

Uzir Islam, 36, of Durgapur village in Aditmari upazila, said a lineman to BGB gets Tk 400 per cattle for bringing them across the border.

Smuggled Indian cattle are being sold openly at cattle markets in Nayarahat, Durakuti Haat in Lalmonirhat Sadar, Chaparhat in Kaliganj upazila, Doikhowa Haat, Barakhata Haat in Hatibandha upazila and Patgram Hat in Patgram upazila.

Commanding Officer of Lalmonirhat BGB 15 Battalion Lieutenant Colonel Ahmed Bazlur Rahman Hayati said the paramilitary force stopped smuggling of Indian cattle in order to reduce border killing.

BGB men are always vigilant along the border, so there is no scope for smuggling, he added

BGB 15 Battalion Durgapur Camp Commander Havildar Saiful Islam said they have been seizing smuggled Indian cattle and selling them in open auction through customs authorities.

Gold smuggling marks sharp rise
Gold smuggling via Bangladesh has reached an alarming level which customs officials say has resulted mainly from the rise in import duty on gold in India.

Smuggling syndicates are using Bangladesh as a transit point to smuggle the yellow metal to India, which has hiked import duty on it thrice to 10 percent since January last year.

This is evident in the recent sharp rise in seizure of smuggled gold by Bangladesh customs officials.

Customs officials seized 220 kg of gold at Dhaka and Chittagong airports in the last three months.

Of those, 107 kg gold was seized from an inbound flight at Chittagong airport on March 25.

In July last year, 1,064 gold bars weighing around 124 kg were seized at Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka.

Customs authorities and local jewellery traders say price gap between the UAE, India and Bangladesh encourages smugglers to bring gold to Dhaka for transporting it to India illegally.

Per 10 gram gold costs about Tk 38,000 in Dubai, more than Tk 40,000 in India and around Tk 46,000 in Bangladesh.

India raised import duty on gold from 2 percent to 4 percent in April 2012, 6 percent in January last year, 8 percent in June and 10 percent in August to stop outflow of foreign currency and reduce the yawning current account deficit.

In May last year, traders in India imported 1.62 lakh kg gold, which came down to 19,300 kg in November following the increase in import duty.

Gold smuggling has become very lucrative for offenders, as smuggling of one kg gold leads to net savings of over 1.5 lakh rupees through legal channel, according to India's Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

The World Gold Council estimates that a staggering 150-200 tonnes of gold is smuggled to India each year.

Indian Border Security Force seized a consignment of smuggled gold worth over 1 crore rupees near Darshana border in Kushtia.

Around 5 percent of the gold smuggled to India comes through Bangladesh, said sources in the BSF and Indian customs.

�Rise in import duty in India has caused this spurt in smuggling through Bangladesh,� a senior official of Bangladesh customs intelligence unit told The Daily Star.

Land ports are also used as transit points for smuggling gold to India via Bangladesh.

It is difficult to contain gold smuggling through land ports due to absence of required facilities, Lt Col Matiur Rahman, commanding officer of Border Guard Bangladesh in Jessore, told The Daily Star.

Payments for cattle smuggled from India are made in gold bars instead of money, said BGB sources.

Honest traders are challenged by smugglers who sell gold at a lower price,� said Dilip Roy, president of Bangladesh Jewellers' Samity.

The 107 kg gold seized at Chittagong airport on March 25 is enough to meet the country's demand for gold for three months, he said.

There is no exact estimate of gold consumption in Bangladesh.

But it's clear that the figure is insignificant compared to that of India, which is world's second largest gold consumer after China.

Bangladeshi traders don't import gold, as its price fluctuates frequently.

If 100 of them bring gold [400 gram] permitted by the law, the amount will be 40 kg,� said Dilip Kumar Agarwal, general secretary of Bangladesh Gems Stone Merchants Association.

On seizure of smuggled gold, customs department deposit it with Bangladesh Bank that later sells it at auction.

�Curbing cattle smuggling can stop border killing�
About ninety five percent of the killings on Bangladesh-India border occur due to cattle smuggling, said Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) today.

�If we can stop the cattle smuggling, border killings can be stopped,� said BGB Director General (DG), Major General Aziz Ahmed at a press conference at its headquarters in Dhaka around 10:00am.

He was briefing journalists about the outcome of the 43rd Border Conference between Bangladesh and India held in New Delhi from September 30 to October 5.

Issues like Yaba smuggling, human trafficking and transnational crimes were also discussed between the two countries during the conference where 22 Bangladeshi high officials, lead by the BGB director general, represented the country.

A list of twelve thousand criminals was handed over to India on behalf of Bangladesh during the conference, Major General Aziz Ahmed told reporters.

New Delhi agreed to monitor cattle smuggling as the cattle is being smuggled from India, the DG also said.

India also agreed to work on handing over Bangladeshi prisoners to the country soon, the DG added.

Migrants clash with Hungary riot police
Hungarian riot police yesterday fired tear gas and water cannon to force migrants back from the Serbia-Hungary border.

Hundreds of people massed at a closed crossing point near the Serbian town of Horgos, and were involved in a tense stand-off with police on the other side of the border.

Many of the migrants want to reach Germany, amid divisions within the EU over how to deal with the crisis.

Tens of thousands of people crossed into Hungary to enter the Europe Union's Schengen zone, which normally allows people to travel between member countries without restrictions.

Hungary closed its entire border with Serbia on Tuesday after making it illegal to enter the country or damage a new razor-wire border fence.

Serbia's foreign ministry protested over the firing of tear gas and water cannon into its territory.

The Hungarian government says 20 police officers were injured as migrants tried to break through a gate, and a spokesman accused migrants of using children as "human shields".

Several people received treatment from the Serbian ambulance service, some suffering the effects of tear gas.

Migrant Amir Hassan, from Iraq, said: "We fled wars and violence and did not expect such brutality and inhumane treatment in Europe."

But Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he considered it "unacceptable that an aggressive group of immigrants took such an action against Hungarian police.

The Hungarian police's duty is to protect Hungary from the entry of such violent persons."

Serbian minister Aleksandar Vulin, visiting the scene, said the migrants' frustration was understandable after Hungary closed the border.

"Hungary must show it is ready and capable to accept these people," he said.

Serbia has said it will send additional police to its border with Hungary.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, called on the Hungarian authorities to ensure "unimpeded access" for people fleeing wars and persecution.

Hungary's hardline anti-migrant stance has been sharply criticised, with the UN refugee agency saying it could be in violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention, says AFP.

Meanwhile, Croatia has said it will allow migrants to travel on to northern Europe, opening up a new route a day after Hungary sealed its border with Serbia.

A steady stream of migrants is crossing into Croatia from Serbia, with some of those stranded on Serbia's border with Hungary now using the same route.

Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "We are ready to accept and direct those people... to where they apparently wish to go."

4 killed in Niger anti-French riots
A ransacked church burns after it was set ablaze, as thousands of protesters gathered following Friday prayers to vent anger at the depiction of the prophet in the publication of a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in the latest edition of the French satirical weekly, Charlie Hebdo, on January 16, 2015 in Zinder.

Muslim anger flared over a French satirical weekly's latest caricature of the Prophet Muhammad, with four people reported killed and dozens injured at a protest Friday in the West African country of Niger, and violent clashes between demonstrators and police in Pakistan, Jordan and Algeria.

The new issue has a drawing of Muhammad, with a tear rolling down his cheek and a placard that reads "Je Suis Charlie" - a saying that has swept France and the world since the killings.

A French cultural center was set ablaze by protesters in the town of Zinder in southern Niger, and one security officer and three demonstrators were killed in the melee, said Interior Minister Hassoumi Massaoudou.

The government of Niger, a former French colony, has banned the sale of Charlie Hebdo.

Demonstrations were held in the Pakistani cities of Karachi, Lahore and the capital of Islamabad.

People walk towards the Evanlegical Church as thousands of protesters gathered after Friday prayers to vent anger at the depiction of the prophet in the publication of a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in the latest edition of the French satirical weekly, Charlie Hebdo, on January 16, 2015 in Zinder.

Clashes erupted in Karachi when protesters started heading toward the French consulate, throwing stones at police, who pushed them back with water cannons and tear gas.

About 1,000 people gathered in Islamabad to condemn the French publication.

They had claimed to be sent by al-Qaeda in Yemen.

On Thursday, Pakistani lawmakers passed a resolution against cartoons of the prophet and marched outside parliament to protest Charlie Hebdo's latest cover.

In Washington Friday night, dozens of Muslims primarily from Pakistan rallied to show solidarity with those demonstrating in Pakistan against terrorism and commemorating the Peshawar school attack one month ago.

In a rare protest in the Algerian capital of Algiers, thousands of young men marched to protest the French satirical newspaper.

Clashes broke out in the Jordanian capital of Amman between security forces and about 2,000 protesters organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest opposition group.

Riot police used batons to disperse the people as they tried to march to the French Embassy.

The crowd chanted slogans against Charlie Hebdo and Jordanian officials for taking part in a unity march in Paris on Sunday.

The Jordanian royal household denounced Charlie Hebdo's latest cover, saying publishing the cartoon was "irresponsible and far from the essence of freedom of expression."

India court convicts 24 over 2002 Gujarat riots massacre
An Indian court convicted two dozen people today over a massacre during religious riots 14 years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister of Gujarat state.

Crowds of supporters, some donning French or Portuguese flags, gathered at the base of the Paris landmark before and after Portugal's stunning 1-0 victory over France after they were refused entry to the fan zone which was packed to its 90,000 capacity, Paris police said.

Other arrests took place outside the Stade de France where the match was played.

Last week, riot police fired tear gas in clashes with youths on the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris after France's qualification for the Euro 2016 final.

Earlier clashes between fans at the June 11 England-Russia match in Marseille left 35 people injured in violence that French prosecutors have largely blamed on around 150 "well-prepared" Russian supporters who carried out targeted attacks on England supporters.

Portugal's shock win over France in the European Championship final was the country's first international title, though superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was forced to watch the match injured from the touchline.

KL to hire workers in three sectors
Malaysian Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri Richard Riot yesterday informed the government that they will hire workers from Bangladesh in three sectors -- construction, plantation and manufacturing.

�We already have an agreement with Malaysia for the workers' recruitment.

The Malaysian government suspended the recruitment of foreign workers from all countries including Bangladesh on February 19, a day after the two governments signed a memorandum of understanding in Dhaka.

After criticisms over an alleged syndicate comprising some selective Bangladeshi recruiting agents, the expatriates' welfare ministry said it will not give any scope of forming a syndicate during the recruitment process.

However, Ruhul Amin, secretary general of Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies, said they are not aware of the Malaysian government's decision yet.

Malaysia has been a popular destination for Bangladeshi migrant workers over the last three decades but the recruitment process has always been tainted by malpractices that result in labour abuses.

Following massive irregularities during 2006 and 2008, Malaysia froze recruitment from Bangladesh in early 2009.

Currently, around three lakh Bangladeshis are working in different sectors in Malaysia legally while a good number of the Bangladeshis are also working without legal documents.

Scores of Rohingyas have fled what they say is persecution in Burma in recent months.

1 killed in riots in India over Cauvery water dispute
At least one person was killed and another wounded when police opened fired to quell rioting that erupted in the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru yesterday over a long-running Cauvery river water dispute with the neighbouring state, an official said today.

The violence erupted after India's Supreme Court ordered Karnataka state, where Bengaluru is located, to release 12,000 cubic feet of water per second per day from the Cauvery river to the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu until Sept. 20.

Bengaluru is home to top Indian IT companies such as Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Mphasis as well as offices of several multinational companies like Samsung Electronics.

Disputes over water resources are common in India, where rising demand and poor management of supplies often lead to angry protests.

Tensions between ethnic Muslims and China's Han majority in the far western Xinjiang region erupted in riots that killed 140 people and injured 828, an official said yesterday, marking the deadliest unrest to hit the volatile area in decades.A peaceful protest Sunday of about 1,000 to 3,000 people in the regional capital, Urumqi, apparently spun out of control, as rioters went on a rampage and clashed with police.

The Xinjiang regional government blamed Rebiya Kadeer, the Uighurs' leader who is living in exile in the United States, for orchestrating the unrest.

However Uighur exiles, who have long chafed at Chinese rule in Xinjiang, accused Chinese security forces of over-reacting in quelling peaceful protests by thousands of people, and said police had fired indiscriminately.

The demonstrators who gathered Sunday had been demanding justice for two Uighurs killed last month during a fight with their Han Chinese co-workers at a factory in southern China.

Other people, who appeared to be Han Chinese, sat dazed with blood pouring down their faces.

Mobile phone service provided by at least one company was cut Monday to stop people from organising further action in Xinjiang.

Tensions between Uighurs and the majority Han Chinese are never far from the surface in Xinjiang, China's vast Central Asian buffer province, where militant Uighurs have waged a sporadic, violent separatist campaign.

The overwhelming majority of Urumqi's 2.3 million people are Han Chinese.

"We are extremely saddened by the heavy-handed use of force by the Chinese security forces against the peaceful demonstrators," said Alim Seytoff, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based Uyghur American Association.

"We ask the international community to condemn China's killing of innocent Uihgurs.

The association, led by a former prominent Xinjiang businesswoman now living in America, Rebiya Kadeer, estimated that 1,000 to 3,000 people took part in the protest.

Xinjiang Governor Nur Bekri said in a televised address early Monday blamed Uighur exiles led by Kadeer of causing the violence, saying, "Rebiya had phone conversations with people in China on July 5 in order to incite and Web sites ... were used to orchestrate the incitement and spread propaganda."

China Mobile phone service was suspended in the region "to help keep the peace and prevent the incident from spreading further," a customer service representative in Urumqi said.

Adam Grode, an American Fulbright scholar studying in Urumqi, described a heavy police and military presence in the city Monday.

"It's common practice for the Chinese government to accuse Ms. Kadeer for any unrest" in Xinjiang, he said.

Seytoff also read a brief statement from Kadeer: "The real cause of the problem lies with the Chinese government's policies toward the Uighurs.

The clashes Sunday in Urumqi echoed last year's unrest in Tibet, when a peaceful demonstration by monks in the capital of Lhasa erupted into riots that spread to surrounding areas, leaving at least 22 dead.

The Chinese government accused the Dalai Lama of orchestrating the violence a charge he denied.

Critics say the millions of Han Chinese who have settled here in recent years are gradually squeezing the Turkic people out of their homeland.

But many Chinese believe the Uighurs (pronounced WEE-gers) are backward and ungrateful for the economic development the Chinese have brought to the poor region.

In 1990, about 200 Uighurs shouting for holy war protested through Baren, a town near the Afghan border, resulting in violence that left at least two dozen people dead.

Four Uighur detainees at the US prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba were recently released and relocated to Bermuda despite Beijing's objections because US officials have said they fear the men would be executed if they returned to China.

Officials have also been trying to transfer 13 others to the Pacific nation of Palau.

India seeks release of workers arrested over UAE riot
United Arab Emirates police arrested more than 3,000 mostly Indian workers after a dining room riot at a construction site in which a manager, security guards and the workers were beaten up, India's ambassador said yesterday.

The ambassador, Talmiz Ahmad, said that the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi was now seeking the release of those not involved in the riot and had made an official approach to the government.

"A total of 3,147 mostly Indian workers were arrested after a small group had a violent altercation in the dining room with the mess manager" at a construction site in the northern emirate of Ras al-Khaimah on Friday evening, the diplomat told AFP by telephone from the capital Abu Dhabi.

"We have informed the UAE government officially through a note and unofficially that while we totally condemn violence, we believe that people not involved in the violence should be released immediately," the envoy said.

Ahmad said the workers were being held in prisons in several of the seven emirates making up the UAE.

Indian diplomats have not had access to the detainees, but sent a fact-finding team to the site of the riot and had spoken to managers of the company that employs the workers and police, he said.

The violence is the latest to hit construction and other working sites in the UAE, an oil-rich Gulf country in the midst of an economic boom where hundreds of thousands of mostly Asian low-paid labourers are employed.

In February, the local press reported that a court in the emirate of Dubai sentenced 45 Indian construction workers to six months in jail followed by deportation over a violent protest to demand wage increases.

Fast-track courts to handle Gujarat riot cases

The Press Trust of India news agency said the Supreme Court ordered that six special courts be established in Gujarat under the supervision of a special investigation team that was set up by the Supreme Court last year.

Modi, projected as a future prime minister of India and a prominent member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has denied any role in the riots.

Egypt halts matches after 22 killed in football riot
Fans used fireworks to set vehicles on fire after the clashes

The Egyptian authorities have suspended football league matches indefinitely after clashes at a stadium in Cairo left at least 22 people dead.

It is just three years since more than 70 Egyptian fans were killed in a riot at a stadium in Port Said.

Hard-core Egyptian football fans are often deeply politicised and played a role in the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

Egypt's public prosecutor has ordered an investigation into the Cairo clashes.

Iran blames foreign govts for killings during riot
Iran yesterday lashed out at foreign governments, accusing them of complicity in crimes and killings in the aftermath of the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

"Western and European countries, with their overt and covert capabilities, interfered in Iran's election... the worst among them being Britain," Mottaki was quoted as saying by the state broadcaster's website.

Iran has consistently blamed foreign countries, especially Western and European nations, for fuelling the post-election violence in Tehran in which officials say about 30 people died and several hundred were wounded.

Tehran has particularly targetted London and had detained nine local employees of the British embassy for their alleged role in the violence that broke out following the disputed re-election of Ahmadinejad.

Ayatollah Ahmad Janati, Iran's hardline cleric and head of the Guardians Council, the powerful electoral watchdog which upheld Ahmadinejad's victory, on Friday blamed Mousavi and Karroubi for the deaths of the protesters.

Another top Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, said the key to restoring calm in the country was to free all those rounded up in the aftermath of the mass demonstrations.

Riot survivors too scared to return home in Assam




There was little time to do anything but grab her two young boys and run as fast as she could when the gunmen came into the northeast Indian village in the dead of night and began firing.

Eighteen days on, Rohima, like hundreds of thousands in Assam state, languishes in a displacement camp - too scared to go home after the worst ethnic violence in India in a decade.

But the government says the violence, in which 75 people have been killed and more than 400,000 displaced, is over and has set a deadline for fleeing villagers to return to their homes - India's Independence Day on August 15.

Bodo say many of the Muslims, who over the years have grown to outnumber the Bodos, are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

The Muslims say they are Indian citizens and have voting rights.

Rangamati Riots
Another ethnicised riot

The Rangamati riots of January 10-13, 2015 are yet another incident of ethnicised violence in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).

The Deputy Commissioner (DC) held a meeting with local leaders on January 12, which was followed by a �peace rally� by people from different ethnic groups.

Otherwise, the report and recommendations of the Inquiry Committee of the September 2012 Rangamati Riots would have been discussed for all they are worth.

The aftermath of the September 2012 Riots in Rangamati�overshadowed by the more infamous Ramu incident of the following week�exemplified a continuing trend, that of impunity.

Both in 2012 and last week, armed rioters were seen moving about within the town's thoroughfares, away from their places of residence (outside of Rangamati?).

Pahari perceptions of Bangali bias

Eyewitnesses of the September 2012 incidents told me that rioters armed with knives and sticks that openly passed through major thoroughfares of Rangamati in daytime and committed violence were �Bangalis.� There were similar allegations on last week's incidents too, but the number of the rioters in the latter case was smaller.

Recommendation on independent commission of inquiry and multi-ethnic police

I wrote to the DC, being legally mandated to advise him.

Previous inquiry commissions on the CHT

Independence and impartiality can be ensured through persons of expertise and integrity.

Examples of ethnically mixed policing

There are examples in numerous countries, such as UK and USA, where racially mixed police were deployed to quell race riots, with positive results.

The writer is the Chakma Raja, Chief of the Chakma Circle, a barrister (an Advocate at the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh) and a member of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.

The criminals entered the house of Crime Reporters' Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) President Parvez Khan breaking the door lock around 1:30pm.

33 killed in new Brazil prison riot
At least 33 inmates were killed by their rivals at a prison in northern Brazil yesterday, days after a riot by warring gangs left dozens more dead at another prison, officials said.

The latest unrest comes a day after President Michel Temer announced the federal government would spend $250 million to build at least one prison in each of Brazil's 26 states to deal with chronic overcrowding blamed for a string of deadly riots.

Rights activists have long condemned prison conditions in Brazil, where the justice ministry says 50 percent more capacity is needed to handle an inmate population swollen by efforts to crack down on a violent and lucrative drug trade.

Human rights activist Teesta Setalvad said she welcomed the news, telling the CNN-IBN network that "finally the Gujarat government has bowed down to the Indian constitution and Indian law."

Communal riot in Myanmar
The Border Guard Bangladesh has increased patrolling and vigilance along the border with Myanmar in the wake of a riot between Rohingya Muslims and majority Buddhists in the neighbouring country.

Police and military units deployed in Rakhine state -- which borders Bangladesh -- had "systematically controlled" unrest, which erupted on Friday and saw hundreds of Buddhist villagers' homes set ablaze, state television said and added, "Stability has been restored since Saturday morning."

Security forces flooded western Myanmar yesterday to prevent further outbreaks of sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims which have left at least seven dead, according to state media.



Talking to The Daily Star, BGB chief Maj Gen Anwar Hossain rejected the allegation of the Myanmar official outright.

Myanmar, which considers the Rohingya as foreigners and not one of the nation's ethnic groups, has an estimated 750,000 Rohingya, living mainly in Rakhine, according to the UN.

A jail riot in south-western Venezuela killed at least 50 people and wounded 90 others on Friday, local media reported, the latest incident in the ongoing crisis in the South American nation's crowded prisons.

Vice President Nicolas Maduro, freshly back in the country after visiting recovering President Hugo Chavez in Cuba, called the riot "regrettable" and "tragic".

Venezuelan prisons are controlled by armed gangs that have rioted repeatedly over the last several years due to disputes with jail authorities or prison leaders.

The South American nation's 34 prisons were designed to hold around a third of the 50,000 inmates now in them, according to local prison advocacy groups.

Police Commissioner AK Khan, however, warned that any untoward incident would lead to re-imposition of the curfew.

Kidnap for ransom


Yesterday's kidnapping happened around 3:30am when the three, along with a patient, were heading towards Baishari of Bandarban from Chittagong Medical College Hospital in an ambulance.

The victims are Abu Taiyab, 40, former member of Baishari union under Naikkhangchhari upazila in Bandarban and his relatives Abu Bakkar, 24, of the same area, and Shah Alam, 32, of Satkania in Chittagong.

Including the three yesterday, at least 26 people have been kidnapped in three districts in the region -- Bandarban, Rangamati and Cox's Bazar -- in the last 10 months.

Family members allege Arakan Liberation Party, a separatist group of Myanmar, Mro National Party, a group in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and some armed robbers of Cox's Bazar are behind these abductions.

Talking to The Daily Star, officials of Ramu, Naikkhangchhari and Ali Kadam police stations said Mro National Party and some armed robbers were responsible for most abductions.

In many cases, family members pay the ransom for the release of their relatives and do not file any case, said Sirajul Islam, officer-in-charge of Lama Police Station.

We arrested four people in connection with the abduction and killing of an indigenous man in Lama,� he said.

Nine Lebanese pilgrims kidnapped in Syria freed
Nine Lebanese Shiite pilgrims kidnapped by rebels in Syria last year have been released, with signs that two Turkish pilots whose abduction was linked to their capture may also be freed.

"The nine Lebanese held in Syria are on their way to Turkey," Lebanon's Interior Minister Marwan Charbel told AFP on Friday.

The country's Prime Minister Najib Mikati added in a statement that the former hostages were "in a secure place and are ready to enter Lebanon".

The release comes after a senior Lebanese security official travelled to Damascus to discuss a prisoner exchange deal to free the group, who were abducted in Syria's northern Aleppo province in May 2012 as their families said they were returning from a pilgrimage to Iran.

Turkey said the detention of two Turkish Airlines pilots kidnapped in Beirut in August was close to ending.

The pilots were abducted by a previously unknown group, which said it had seized the pair to secure the release of the nine Lebanese citizens held captive in Syria.

"Very favourable developments are under way concerning the two Turkish pilots.

This matter has been largely settled," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on local television, adding that the men could be freed "within hours or days".

The relatives of the nine Lebanese pilgrims have denied responsibility for kidnapping the pilots, though they said they were happy to see additional pressure placed on Ankara.

They had accused Turkey of not doing enough to win the release of their loved ones from Syrian rebels.

On August 9, gunmen ambushed a bus carrying a Turkish Airlines crew from Beirut's international airport to a hotel in the city, and snatched the pilot and co-pilot.

A group calling itself Zuwwar Imam al-Rida claimed the abduction, and demanded that Turkey use its influence with Syrian rebels it backs to secure the release of the nine Lebanese Shiites.

The Islamic militant group said last week, days after it freed 19 South Korean hostages captured July 19, that kidnapping was an "effective" tool against the government and a tactic it would continue.

Killed after kidnap
Sultan

Concealing his real identity, an accused in the case filed for abduction and killing of Chittagong businessman Jamaluddin Ahmed Chowdhury had holed up for nine long years in Cox's Bazar.

Detective Branch of Chittagong Metropolitan Police arrested the accused, Sultan Driver alias Kala Sultan alias Nurul Islam, at Lighthouse Para in the district town on Sunday night.

Sultan told the detectives that Jamaluddin was killed after abduction on orders from Abul Kashem alias Kashem Chairman, a former chairman of Kanchan Nagar union in Fatikchhari upazila.

He added that they had first become confused as Sultan identified himself as Nurul Islam hailing from South Madarsa in Hathazari.

The DB handed over Sultan to Fatikchhari Police Station on Monday.

Abul Kashem

Jamaluddin, a former BNP leader of Chittagong south district unit, was abducted on the way to his residence in Chandgaon residential area from his business firm at Chawkbazar in the port city on July 24, 2003.

Sultan also told the detectives that the abductors had taken Jamaluddin to Fatikchhari and handed him over to Sultan and three others -- Kala Mahbub, Lomba Mahbub and Tengra Osman -- in Chara Batal area.

A few days later in the same year, the High Court issued a stay order on the hearing on the narazi petition.

Nine foreigners kidnapped in Yemen
Nine foreigners, including women and children, have been kidnapped in a volatile mountainous area of northern Yemen, an official said on Sunday amid conflicting reports over their fate.

Seven Germans, a British engineer and a South Korean woman teacher were seized by Shia rebels in the Saada region, a local official cited on the defence ministry website said, but a rebel spokesman denied any involvement

The group -- including a German couple, three children and two women nurses -- belong to an international relief group that has been working at a hospital in Saada for 35 years, the official said.

Seoul confirmed that a South Korean woman, identified by her family name Eom, 34, had been missing since Thursday evening in Yemen when she joined members of the relief group for a walk.

In Berlin, a foreign ministry spokesman declined to confirm the kidnapping of its nationals, saying only that the German embassy in Sanaa was in "close contact" with Yemeni authorities.

The British and German embassies "consider the group missing, as there has not been any contact with them since Friday evening, while reports of their kidnapping are yet to be confirmed," a diplomat in Sanaa told AFP.

Abductions of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in Yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government's arm in local disputes.

All have been freed unharmed, except for three Britons and an Australian seized by Islamist militants in December 1998 who were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers' hideout.

In April, a Dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces.

Yemen, ancestral homeland of al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets, most recently suicide bombings against South Korean tourists claimed by a local al-Qaeda branch.

An offshoot of Shia Islam, Zaidis are a minority in the mainly Sunni Yemen but form the majority in the northwest.

Kidnapped, treated like slaves of past
Emran Hossain and Mohammad Ali Zinnat did an extensive investigation into human trafficking from Bangladesh to Malaysia.

The 22-year-old man, along with 13 others, was kept confined to a shack for a day in Teknaf's Noapara before he was sent to Malaysia as slave labour through the Bay of Bengal via Thailand.

The captives felt so miserable that they begged the captors to send them to Malaysia instead of torturing them.

He and the other 13 abductees were bundled into a boat that left Teknaf's Kochubuniya for Thailand on November 31, 2013.

Jewel was rescued from a Thai jungle on January 26 last year, while the fate of the other 13 is still unknown.

Jewel took a three-hour bus ride from his home in Ukhia, and fell straight into the traffickers' trap.

In a similar way, human traffickers tricked Mohammad Ismail, a house painter in Ukhia, promising him higher pay.

Ismail's friend Osman told him to see a person in Teknaf for getting work.

Aged 23, Ismail was forced into a boat to Thailand in early 2013.

Fortunately, he was rescued by Thai police in January last year.

The story of Afaz Uddin, a farmer in Ukhia, was a bit different.

A person named Jamal, whom Afaz knew for six months, invited him to his house in Teknaf's Noapara.

One example is the abduction of two Madrasa students by human traffickers in Teknaf.

Ali gave them false hopes of becoming rich, saying all they needed to do was take a sea voyage to Malaysia and work there for only a few years.

Hossain then hired a CNG-run auto-rickshaw and brought the boys to the house of human trafficker Khuilla Mia at Quainchhori in Teknaf.

When Ibrahim told Khuilla that he was no longer interested in travelling to Malaysia, the trafficker and his accomplices beat him up.

On information from Ibrahim's father, a team of Border Guard Bangladesh raided Khuilla's house about three hours later, and rescued the two boys.

Making false promises, human traffickers trapped another boy, Mohammad Ismail, a seventh-grade student of Goyalmara Dakhil Madrasa, in Ukhia in September last year.

The 17-year-old was tricked by his neighbours Shafi Alam and Ramzan Ali, who took him to a house in Paschim Sonapara by a CNG-run auto-rickshaw on November 9 to send him to Malaysia as slave labour.

Five Afghans kidnapped
Five Afghans linked to international groups working in Afghanistan have been kidnapped, officials said yesterday in the latest in a slew of abductions blamed on Taliban rebels or criminals.

Two workers with the Danish Committee for Aid to Afghan Refugees (DACAAR) were abducted on Sunday in the province of Logar about 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Kabul, their organisation told AFP here.

A Bangladeshi national working with a microfinance development project was kidnapped in the same area on September 15 by men who demanded ransom through a video clip sent to a local television station.

Two Turkish nationals kidnapped in Nigeria
Gunmen have kidnapped two Turkish nationals from their hotel in southern Nigeria's oil-rich Akwa Ibom state, police said yesterday in the latest unrest to hit the restive Niger Delta.

"Two Turkish nationals working for a construction company in Onna local government area were abducted from their hotel rooms on Sunday," state police spokesman Chukwu Okechukwu told AFP.

He said the men, who work for BKS Construction Company which is based in Onna, were seized by gunmen from a hotel in Eket, an industrial city which is home to Mobil, the Nigerian subsidiary of US oil giant Exxon.

In January, a Turkish teacher was abducted from a school just outside Lagos along with another two staff members and five students, police said, indicating that they were freed two weeks later.

Kidnapping for ransom was rife in the Niger delta until a 2009 government amnesty drastically reduced unrest in the region.

But the region has seen a resurgence of militancy since 2016, cutting Nigeria's oil output at a time of global low crude prices, hurting government revenue and forcing Africa's most populous country into a recession.

ISIS militants kidnap Bangladeshi
A Bangladeshi was among nine foreign nationals taken hostage by Islamic State militants in an attack on an oilfield in Libya on Friday.

The victim, Helal Uddin, 40, from Madarganj upazila in Jamalpur, has been working in the North African country for the last six years, according to his family and the foreign ministry.

�The incident happened when gunmen invaded the al-Ghani oilfield to the south of the Libyan city of Sirte on Friday killing eleven guards, beheading a number of them before local forces fought back to retake control,� read a statement of the ministry yesterday.

International media reported that the kidnapped foreigners were working for the Austrian oil services company VAOS and they included four Filipinos, a Ghanaian, an Austrian and a Czech.

Local officials said the Islamic State's Libyan affiliate during the attack also beheaded eight guards on the spot.

But Friday's incident was the first instance of a Bangladeshi being held hostage by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, though Dhaka has not joined the alliance against the terrorist group, considering the security of millions of Bangladeshis working in the Middle East.

"Sadly, one Bangladeshi national has been taken hostage and our mission in Tripoli has launched all-out efforts to find out Helal Uddin," a senior official at the foreign ministry told The Daily Star.

The official, however, admitted that it's highly difficult for the mission in Tripoli to function or move smoothly in the turmoil of Libya.

Moreover, the government has recently appointed Major General Shahidul Islam as the ambassador to Libya and he is very new there.

According to the foreign ministry statement, Bangladesh embassy is in close contact with National Oil Company (NOC) of Libya and the Australian company VAOS.

Also yesterday, Helal Uddin's family expressed deep concern over the abduction and appealed to the government for steps to get him released, reported our correspondent from Jamalpur.

Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that the abductees include two Bangladeshis.

The attacks in recent weeks have forced Libya to declare 11 fields, including al-Ghani non-operational.

Libya's military spokesman, Ahmed al-Mesmari, warned on Monday that Islamic State militants' long-term goal is to take over Libya's petroleum industry.

"This is the lifeline of the Libyan people."

Four years after the ouster of Col Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is caught up in conflict between two rival factions with their armed forces fighting for the country's oil wealth.

However, Bangladesh has no plan yet to repatriate the migrants from Libya.

During the Libyan crisis in 2011, over 36,000 Bangladeshi workers were brought back from the North African country.

According to the ministry, there are nearly 25,000 Bangladeshis working in Libya.

Sylhet numbed
A police constable yesterday confessed before a court to have kidnapped and killed a nine-year-old boy for ransom in Sylhet.

Sylhet police rescued Abu Sayeed's body wrapped in sacks from the attic of Constable Ebadur Rahman's house at Kumarpara in the city on Saturday night.

�Ebadur kidnapped the boy for money, but killed him as he [Sayeed] recognised the policeman,� said a court official, citing the constable's confessional statement to the Sylhet Metropolitan Magistrate's Court-1 of Shahedul Karim.

Police also arrested two other accused in the crime -- Geda Mia, a source of law enforcers, and N Islam Talukder alias Rakib, general secretary of Sylhet district Ulama League.

As the Sylhet Kotwali Police launched an investigation on Wednesday night, they tracked the mobile number used to demand the ransom.

�Evidence suggests the boy was strangled to death,� said Shamimur Rahman, inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department in Sylhet.

The family, originally from Sunamganj, moved to Sylhet for better education of the children.

Two people were killed, one by cattle thieves and another in a clash with police over handover of a captured thief, in Mostafanagar village of Companyganj in Sylhet yesterday.

Around 100 others were injured in the clash, including 10 policemen, who took treatment at Sylhet Police Lines Hospital and Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital.

Whale sharks and tarsiers

A Filipino photographer in the area saw a hut burning and about 20 soldiers armed with a machine gun and automatic rifles trading intermittent fire with unseen snipers all afternoon at a cornfield near the Inabanga river.

The armed men sailed upriver from Inabanga, a farming and fishing coastal community some 780 kilometres away from the Abu Sayyaf stronghold of Jolo in the southern Philippines, local police told AFP.

The Abu Sayyaf, also blamed for deadly bombings, has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State movement that holds large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

Over the past year the Abu Sayyaf has been expanding its activities, boarding commercial and fishing vessels off their southern island stronghold of Jolo, near Malaysia, and abducting dozens of foreign crew members.

They beheaded a German tourist in February and two Canadian tourists last year.

SAIFUL ABDUCTION

Detectives have arrested two people at Jatrabari in the capital in connection with the abduction of businessman Saiful Islam.

ABDUCTION IN NOAKHALI

A trader in Begumganj upazila of Noakhali was rescued yesterday a day after his abduction.

Begumganj Police later took him to the police station.

(Our Narayanganj and Noakhali correspondents contributed to this report)

Where its protagonist tries to take a mute six-year-old Pakistani girl back to her homeland to reunite her with her family?

A man with a magnanimous spirit, Bajrangi (Salman Khan) eventually completes his mission with the help of a Pakistani journalist, though after many ordeals.

Now meet the real-life Bajrangi Bhaijaan (Brother Bajrangi) from Bangladesh.

Jamal Ibne Musa, a 52-year-old man from Barguna, has made all the arrangements to reunite an Indian boy, apparently trafficked, with his family.

The boy is now at Jessore Kishore Unnayan Kendra, a government correction centre.

According to Musa and an official at the centre, Rahima Begum and Aklima Begum of Geramardan village under Betagi upazila in Barguna tricked Sonu and brought him to Bangladesh from India in 2010.

Case documents show, Sonu is the son of Mehbub of Dilshan Garden area in the Indian capital.

In December last year, Musa ran into Sonu, when he fled the house for the third time, on the Barguna court premises.

He then took the boy under his custody and brought him to Dhaka, and spoke with police officials and rights activists about sending the boy back home.

On their advice, he took the boy to Barguna.

Later that day, the court sent the boy to Jessore Kishore Unnayan Kendra.

I lost my job as a manger of a private company in Dhaka and I was in jail for 41 days in two phases.

On May 14, he left for India to trace Sonu's family.

"His parents were so happy to hear the news of their missing son.�

The External Affairs Ministry of India was informed about the whole thing through the local police.

In a tweet, the Indian External Affairs Minister on May 23 thanked everyone for bringing the matter to her notice and said they already initiated action in this regard.

Md Shahbuddin, an official at the correction centre, said Ramakant Gupta, first secretary (consular) of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, visited the centre on Tuesday and Wednesday and spoke with the boy to collect necessary information.

�We assured the Indian High Commission that Dhaka will extend all-out support in sending the boy back to New Delhi,� he told this newspaper.

Contacted, a diplomat at the Indian mission said, �He [boy] is being treated very well at the shelter.

The boy wants to go back to his parents and we are trying our best to send him back home as soon as possible.�

Barguna police, however, found nothing wrong with the alleged roles of Rahima and Aklima.

But Jahirul Islam, a sub-inspector of Betagi Police Station, said, �The boy is their nephew.

Eight members of a gang, who allegedly abduct people for ransom identifying themselves as law enforcers, were detained by the newly-formed anti-kidnapping squad at the capital's Badda on Sunday night.

A paper bearing the mark 'DB- police' in Bangla was pasted on a windshield of the 12-seater microbus, he told a press briefing at the media centre of Dhaka Metropolitan Police yesterday afternoon.

There was another group of about 5 armed men who managed to escape by another microbus during the operation in Aftabnagar area at Badda, Roy said.

2015: The Global Terror
AS 2015 draws to a close, we stand witness to another year of world-wide terrorist activities threatening peace and security.

The most dangerous terrorist organisation in the world today is the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or simply the Islamic State (IS).

Boko Haram, a terrorist group that originated in Nigeria, has now expanded its operations to neighbouring Central African states.

Al-Shabab, which originated from Somalia, now operates throughout East Africa.

Besides these, there are many other Islamic militant groups, such as Abu Sayyaf of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) operating in Southern Philippines, Jemaah Islamiah in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in Pakistan, Indian Mujahedin in India etc.

In Bangladesh, too, we have organisations such as Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh (JMB) and Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami Bangladesh (HUJI-B) among others.

At the end of 2015, the IS faces increasing military pressure all along its border � Kurdish Peshmarga advancing from the north, reorganised Iraqi Army pushing from the south, a revitalised Syrian Army attacking from the southwest, and a sustained air campaign since 2014 by the US-led coalition, now joined by the Russians since September 2015.

Thus, in the later part of 2015, we saw a spike in the IS-inspired attacks in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, France and lastly in the USA.

The two most recent IS inspired terrorist attacks that shook the world were: the November 13 attack in Paris when gunmen and suicide bombers killed more than 100, and on December 2, when a couple with alleged ISIS ties killed 14 people in San Bernardino, CA, USA.

Meanwhile in Africa, the Boko Haram occupied a large part of the Northern Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa -- kidnapping girls and selling them as sex slaves, burning down villages, bombing Christian churches and so on.

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, Taliban forces continue to regroup and rearm.

Despite repeated attempts, Pakistan and Afghanistan could not coordinate their anti-terrorist efforts; in fact, the mistrust is so deep that a joint anti-Taliban operation could never be launched.

It is hoped that in 2016, Pakistan and Afghanistan will work out a joint military strategy to fight the Talibans.

Here in Bangladesh, we witnessed targeted killing of five blogger-writers who opposed fundamentalists and religious extremists.

The group published a hit-list that carried names of many top writers, intellectuals and rights activists of Bangladesh.

It was also involved in April this year in a spectacular bank heist outside Dhaka.

Another group that has been active for a long time is Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh (JMB).

There had also been attacks on Shia religious sites, an unprecedented occurrence in Bangladesh.

The attack on the Friday congregation inside the naval base in Chittagong on December 19 signals the looming danger of religious extremism and terrorism in Bangladesh.

The call by the Saudi government on December 16 to set up a Saudi-led Islamic Anti-IS coalition could be interpreted as a step in that direction, but there remains many uncertainties about the coalition.

For example, Saudi Arabia is often blamed for aiding, abetting and financing Islamic extremists groups around the world.

Turkey, one of the members of this coalition, has also been blamed for aiding the IS in its global recruitment process.

It would be too early to predict the outcome, if any, from the Saudi initiative.

2 Brac officials abducted in Afghanistan
Two Bangladeshi Brac officials working in Afghanistan were abducted by unidentified miscreants from Kunduz city yesterday.

Both hailed from Pabna district.

Some gunman kidnapped three Brac officials, including an Afghan national, while they were going to Baghlan from Kunduz around 4:00pm local time, Mahbubul Alam Kabir, senior media manager of Brac, told UNB.

He said the miscreants later released the Afghan citizen.

Brac has been working in Afghanistan since 2002.

The cheating was discovered only after police arrested �abductee� Mehedi Hasan, 30, from Tinmatha intersection in Bogra's Gabtoli upazila headquarters on Friday, 11 days after he went into hiding, said law enforcers.

Later that day, cops picked up his wife Ayesha Akhtar, 25, and student Yusuf Uddin, 25, from Naruli and Chelopara of Bogra town for their alleged involvement in the cheating.

He completed BSc in textile engineering last year from Noakhali Govt Textile Engineering College.

Two days later, Abul filed an abduction case with Bogra Sadar Police Station, accusing unnamed people of the crime.

Mehedi opened �Perfect Coaching� in Banani of Bogra town a few months ago by spending Tk 5 lakh.

He recently decided to cook up the abduction scheme only after his father, a private school teacher from Gozaria village in Sonatola upazila, pushed him to repay the loan.

Yusuf of Kazipur upazila in Sirajganj used at least four SIM cards to call Mehedi's father asking for ransom.

The two left Shantahar of Bogra on August 3 afternoon and travelled to Gaibandha, Rangpur, Nilphamari, Dinajpur, Khulna, Pirojpur and Bagerhat before returning to Bogra two days ago.

Kidnapped Japanese tourist freed in Iran
Tokyo confirmed a report early yesterday that rebels in southeastern Iran had freed a Japanese tourist kidnapped in October.

Satoshi Nakamura, 23, was released "in good condition" late Saturday, a Japanese foreign ministry official said here.

"But we still don't know about further details such as where he was released or when he can come back to Japan," he added.

Nakamura was abducted on October 8 in a region of southeast Iran bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan as he headed from his hotel for the ancient mud-built citadel of Bam in Kerman province.

He had been travelling alone after teaching Japanese and English in Nepal with a volunteer group.

Nine Bangladeshi migrants, who were rescued by Iranian police from the clutches of traffickers, returned home this morning.

The Iranian police rescued at least 80 Bangladeshis, including the nine, with the help of Bangladesh Embassy in Tehran and CID between February and March.

Rights Jessore, an NGO, with the help of the Bangladesh embassy arranged their repatriation.

The traffickers, who also happen to be Bangladeshi, abducted their fellow countrymen from the UAE for ransom and took them to Iran.

The migrants were abducted last year by a gang of Bangladeshi human traffickers based in Iran.

The gang persuaded the migrants in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman to cross into Iran and have lucrative jobs in Turkey, Greece, and Italy with huge salaries.

None of 77 kidnapped fishermen rescued yet
None of the 77 fishermen, kidnapped for ransom by pirates from coastal areas off Patuakhali and Barguna districts on July 5 and 6, are yet to be rescued.

During the attacks from afternoon on Monday last to Tuesday morning, pirate gangs Raju Bahini, Zulfikar Bahini and Mujahid Bahini looted hilsa fish, cash and fuel worth over Tk 20 lakh from 50 trawlers about 40 km to the south of Kuakata in Patuakhali.

Afterwards the gang kidnapped 50 fishermen and went towards the Sundarbans, said the fellow fishermen who returned after the incident.

Bullet-hit during the incident, fisherman Kalu Howlader, 35, later received treatment at Mohipur health centre in Kalapara upazila.

Pirates also looted 30 other trawlers from Pathorghata of Barguna district and kidnapped at least 27 fishermen demanding ransom of Tk one lakh per fisherman, said Golam Mostafa Chowdhury, president of Barguna District Fishing Trawler Owners Association.

Law enforcers should take immediate step to release the kidnapped fishermen from the pirate gangs in Sundarbans," said Abdur Rob, 45, of Laplee village, also father of kidnapped fisherman Jalil.

Wife of another kidnapped fisherman Jahirul, Aysa Begum, 28, of Mithaganj village under Kalapara upazila, said, "My husband is the only earning member of our family consisting of six members.

When contacted, Lt Musfiqur Rahman, Navy contingent commander in Pathorghata, said, "We have started searching in the Sundarbans to rescue the fishermen from the pirates.

US journo, AFP contributor, kidnapped in Syria
A freelance American reporter who contributed videos to Agence France-Presse (AFP) in recent months was kidnapped in war-torn Syria six weeks ago and has been missing since, his family revealed yesterday.

US journalist James Foley, 39, an experienced war reporter who has covered other conflicts, was seized by armed men in the northern province of Idlib on November 22, according to witnesses.

"We want Jim to come safely home, or at least we need to speak with him to know he's okay," said John Foley, father of the missing reporter who also contributes to the US-based international news website GlobalPost and to major US TV channels.

Foley was previously kidnapped and held for six weeks by forces loyal to slain Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi while covering that civil war last year.

The reason for the men's abduction in Syria remains unclear.

Large parts of northern Syria are controlled by anti-Assad rebel groups that form part of the Free Syrian Army or are made up of jihadists, including foreign fighters.

Kidnapped Brac staff in Afghanistan
The abduction of two Brac officials from the Afghan town of Ghazni last Thursday came as a rude shock to us, more so, when till the time of writing this editorial no trace has yet been found about their whereabouts.

Ironically, the two men were engaged in development activities having nothing to do with Afghanistan's highly volatile, explosive political situation.

True, the feuding groups are at war against each other, but there is obviously no point in targeting innocent development workers whose only mission in Afghanistan is to serve the country and its people.

We appreciate the Afghan government's assurance to our foreign ministry that all out efforts are being made to rescue the Brac officials.

Brac, as a matter of policy, is planning to gradually wind up its programmes in Afghanistan within the next five years.

The Nato forces present in Afghanistan should also take note of the crimes being committed against people engaged in humanitarian activities.

Security of such people should be high on the agenda of the countries and agencies striving to bring back normalcy to Afghanistan.

Police also arrested the kidnapper, Abdullah Al Mamun, 22, son of Sirajul Islam Dhali of village Modhya Khalishabunia in Shyamnagar upazila.

Zakia Sultana Sathi, 14, daughter of Abdullah of Puratan Satkhira in the town and a student of class nine was kidnapped while returning from her school.

6 Bangladeshis kidnapped by Nasaka
Mayanmar border security force Nasaka has kidnapped six Bangladeshi nationals from Aju Khaiya border in Naikhongchhari upazila, locals said.

The Bangladeshi nationals are Nurul Kabir, Nurul Bashar, Abul Bashar, Shamsul Alam, Badiul Alam and Nurul Islam, all hailing from Aju Khaiya village in Ghum Dhum union.

THE killing, torture, abduction and kidnapping of Bangladesh civilians at the border by Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) disturb the minds of the people in Bangladesh.

Although the number has reduced in recent times, the continuation of such tragic incidents on regular basis has led an overwhelming section of people in Bangladesh to believe that India does not care about the loss of lives of Bangladeshis.

Furthermore, loss of one life is contrary to the Indo-Bangladesh joint communiqu� of January 2010 (paragraph 18) signed by the prime ministers of Bangladesh and India.

Many researchers from Bangladesh and India have found that there is a simple way to end the killings at the border because such killings are mostly related to illegal cattle trade from India to Bangladesh.

During Track II dialogue between India and Bangladesh, Bangladesh side had repeatedly suggested to the Indian side to legalise the export of cows from West Bengal, a state in which cows can be slaughtered, to end the border killings.

The legalisation of export of cows could also help curb tension on the volatile border.�

The cattle smuggled are brought from far flung Indian states like Haryana, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

15,000 when it crosses the Indian border.

40,000 in Bangladeshi markets.

Bangladesh nationals are killed when they, reportedly, fail to �grease the palms� of the border officials including security guards.

The vast illegal trade thrives since cows are considered holy in India, and New Delhi is unable to legalise their export.

We shall begin a countrywide agitation if India decides to export cows to a country where they are likely to be slaughtered for meat.�

Given the above facts, cow-export is a highly emotive and sensitive matter for New Delhi.

While India cannot export cows to Bangladesh, the sheer profit will drive illegal cattle trade.

But it is happening allegedly under the nose of Indian border officials.

The writer is a former Bangladesh Ambassador to the UN, Geneva.

Kidnapped Brac worker
We share the concern of our compatriots over the unfortunate incident of abduction in Afghanistan of a Bangladeshi development worker named Nurul Islam from his Brac office premises.

Brac has been working in Afghanistan on micro-financing projects since 2002, so that its efficacy and credibility as an institution are well established facts in that country.

Brac is working for the good of the Afghan people who do realise that they are beneficiaries of the projects extensively undertaken by the NGO.

Brac and our foreign ministry have taken up the matter with the Afghan government with utmost seriousness.

The Afghan police have already arrested three men calling them criminals and adding they are not linked to Taliban insurgents.

Nurul Islam is supposed to have been whisked away across to Pakistan from where he would be brought back in a few days.

A scooping investigation must be carried out into the incident in order to determine the level of risk involved in carrying out NGO work in Afghanistan.

Tale of a big time thief




Book @ zine, shop 1-2 Basement, Jordine House, 1 Connaught Road Central, Hong Kong was one of the sites for the biggest book sale of the year.

It is about the rise and role of the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan as one of the architects of the second nuclear age.

He is said to have been ambitious and though labeled a 'mediocre' professional, he helped Pakistan build the bomb and enabled regional countries acquire, for the first time, nuclear information and technology.

His one and only aim was to protect his country from arch rival India.

He told visiting Pakistani scientists about his plan to build a nuclear weapon to save his country from India.Their response was discouraging.

Earlier, in 1972, Bhutto had toured the Middle East, scouting for funds to build Pakistan's nuclear program.

He had in 1971 wept over the Pakistani surrender, the permanent division of Pakistan and the emergence of the new nation of Bangladesh.

One clear objective of BCCI's international finance super fraud was the provision to Pakistan, privately and through public finance, of the means to create the necessary nuclear industry as the foundation for the country's weapons program.

He observes that at each juncture over more than twenty years, the CIA had both the clear evidence, and the means for stopping the Pakistani project, but in each instance decided against that track and in favor of more passive watching and waiting in hopes of finding yet more tentacles of Khan's nuclear marketplace.

During the Reagan years the policy was to downplay any aspect of non-proliferation policy in favor of short-term political interests, such as maintaining Pakistani support for the 1980 war in Afghanistan.

Any official could be linked to responsibility for the Khan network's success in building the Pakistani Bomb, and spreading the industrial knowledge of wide-spread proliferation.

Later the criminals through cell-phone demanded a ransom of Tk 10 lakh from Yakub's family members who lodged a complaint with Rab-9 in Sylhet.

Being informed by Rab-9 that Yakub was taken to Saltgola area in Chittagong, a team from Rab-7 posing as negotiators contacted with the kidnappers through cell-phone and made a deal to pay the ransom money.

2 Brac officials abducted in Afghanistan
Unidentified criminals abducted two Bangladeshi Brac officials in Kunduz of war-torn Afghanistan on Thursday.

They are engineer Shawkat Ali, 50, and accountant Sirajul Islam Sumon, 37, of Pabna.

Some gunmen kidnapped three Brac officials, including an Afghan national, while they were going to Baghlan from Kunduz around 4:00pm local time, reports UNB, quoting Brac Senior Media Manager Mahbubul Alam Kabir as saying.

He said the criminals released the Afghan citizen later.

The families of the two Bangladeshis were passing anxious moments and called upon the Bangladesh government to take steps for the quick release of the two abductees, adds our Pabna correspondent.

Lota Khatun, wife of Sirajul who hails from Dubulia village in Pabna Sadar upazila, said her husband and Shawkat Ali, of Hangragari in Faridpur upazila, were picked up when they were on their way to a project site in Afghanistan.

Brac has been working in Afghanistan since 2002.

The elite force arrested the five from different areas in Uttara and recovered Tk 1.8 crore from their possession.

Rezaul and Mizan had planned it four months ago and rented a house at Pallabi to execute the plan, he added.

Mizan followed the private car carrying Abeer from his madrasa in Uttara to their Banani house.

Kidnapped Helal talks with family from Libya
Bangladesh labourer Helal Uddin, who was kidnapped by militants in Libya on March 6, talked with his family in Jamalpur over phone today.

The phone call at around 10:30am came as pleasant surprise for not only Helal�s family but also all the people of Dakkhin Gazaria village of Madarganj Upazila as they were keeping praying for his release since the news broke earlier this month.

Unknown militants abducted Helal Uddin and Anowar Hossain, 38, another Bangladeshi from Goyeshpur village in Noakhali, along with seven other foreigners -- four Filipinos, an Austrian, a Czech and a Ghana national � from the Al-Ghani oil field, south of city of Sirte.

�As he could not recognise my mother�s voice first, he asked for me,� Helema, the eldest of his three daughters and two sons, told The Daily Star�s Jamalpur correspondent.

Bangladesh foreign ministry in a press statement on March 9 said much-feared terrorist group Islamic State had abducted them.

But State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam yesterday told journalists that no militant group in Libya claimed responsibility for the abduction of the two Bangladeshis.

Bangladesh embassy officials in Tripoli said they were in touch with embassies of the Philippines and Austria and also with the Libyan authorities for their rescue.

How can I go to school?� said Rubel, student of class IX at Adarvita High School.

Aleya Khatun, wife of Helal, said her carpenter husband last came to Bangladesh 10 months back.

Then in 2009, he went to Libya to seek his fortune.

Meanwhile, Anowar Hossain of Noakhali was a diploma electrical engineer.

He had first gone to Libya in 2010 and then again in 2012, according to our Noakhali correspondent.

Earlier, he had worked in Saudi Arabia since 2001.

The couple have two children -- Rahin, 7, and Raisha, 5 -- who are studying at Matuail Creative International School in Dhaka.

Then she contacted Anowar's friend Moinul Hossain in Libya who quoted Anowar's company as saying that ISIS took him hostage.

Mahmud Iqbal, Anowar's brother-in-law, said he was in touch with foreign ministry officials in Dhaka and the Bangladesh embassy in Tripoli for the immediate release of his relative.

'Obama's daughter to be kidnapped, raped'
An Iranian strategic expert has warned that one of President Obama's daughters will be kidnapped and raped if America attacks Syria.

Alireza Forghani, also the former governor of southern Iran�s Kish Province, warned of mass abductions and killings of American citizens worldwide in the event the Obama administration launches a military strike in Syria.

'Hopefully Obama will be pigheaded enough to attack Syria, and then we will see the � loss of US interests [through terrorist attacks],' he threatened.

'In just 21 hours [after the attack on Syria], a family member of every US minister [department secretary], US ambassadors, US military commanders around the world will be abducted.

The threat comes amid reports today that the U.S has intercepted an order from an Iranian official instructing militants in Iraq to attack US interests in Baghdad if the attack goes ahead.

The American embassy in Baghdad was a likely target, according to unnamed US officials quoted by the Wall Street Journal.

In addition, the State Department issued a warning on Thursday telling US citizens to avoid all but 'essential' travel to Iraq.

President Barack Obama has asked the US Congress to back his plan for limited strikes in response to a chemical weapons attack on civilians that the United States blames on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.



The newspaper said the message went to Iranian-supported Shi'ite militia groups in Iraq.

The Journal reported that the message informed Shi'ite groups to be prepared to respond with force after any US military strike on Syria.

'Travel within Iraq remains dangerous given the security situation,' according to the State Department's warning, which replaced an earlier one 'to update information on security incidents and to remind US citizens of ongoing security concerns in Iraq, including kidnapping and terrorist violence.'

The department said that numerous insurgent groups, including al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate, remain active and 'terrorist activity and sectarian violence persist in many areas of the country at levels unseen since 2008.'

The US and France are so far the only nations attending the G20 to have backed the use of military force against the Assad regime, with Russia and China insisting that any action in the absence of UN Security Council approval would be illegal.

150 kidnapped Afghan labourers freed
Taliban militants on Saturday released the last of approximately 150 Afghan labourers they had abducted for almost a week after suspecting the workers of being Afghan soldiers, officials said.

Militants stopped three buses of workers constructing an Afghan army base in the western city of Farah and took the labourers hostage on Sept. 21.

"The Taliban had received a report that these people were going to join with Afghan army, that they are receiving training in this camp that they are building," said Abdul Qadir Daqeq, a provincial council member from Farah.

He said that no ransom was paid and that the Taliban didn't demand the release of militants in Afghan prisons, as they have done in other kidnapping cases.

Kidnappings in Afghanistan are an increasingly common tactic used by militants and common criminals to instil terror, to make political demands and to blackmail families or governments for ransom.

The Afghan government has released Taliban prisoners in exchange for a kidnapped Italian journalist, and other countries and families are known to have made large ransom payments to win the release of abductees.

Diplomat kidnapped in Pakistan is alive, says Iran
An Iranian diplomat kidnapped last month in Pakistan is alive, Tehran's ambassador to Islamabad was quoted by a newspaper as saying yesterday.

Gunmen kidnapped Hashmatullah Attarzadeh on his way to the consulate in Peshawar in northwest Pakistan on November 13 and killed his local guard.

"The embassy's efforts to locate him have been somewhat satisfactory and we have learned with Pakistani security officials' help that he is alive," Mashallah Shakeri was quoted as saying by mass-circulation Hamshahri newspaper.

"We hope he will return to his family soon," the Iranian ambassador added.

There has been a recent surge in violence in Peshawar blamed on Islamic militants from the ousted Taliban regime, while Pakistani troops have increased operations along the country's porous border with Afghanistan.

Iran has strongly condemned the "terrorist" kidnapping in its eastern neighbour and made it clear that the diplomat's safety was Islamabad's responsibility.

Kidnapped Bangladeshi rescued in Malaysia
He was a Bangladeshi worker living on a measly salary at a convenience store.

For a group of kidnappers, however, this 39-year-old Bangladeshi was a quick way to make a fast buck.

�They used the victim�s mobile phone to contact his family in Bangladesh, demanding a ransom of RM400,000 and threatened to kill him should they fail to pay up,� he said.

ACP Yahaya added yesterday the victim�s wife, who was in Bangladesh, called a relative in Malaysia to inform him of the abduction.

The relative immediately lodged a police report and an operation was carried out to rescue the Bangladeshi.

ACP Yahaya said the money was sent from Bangladesh via online transaction.

Police, however, arrested two Myanmar lab�o�u���rers, aged 23 and 33, at a restaurant in Sem�en�yih on Jan 25 in connection with the crime.

�We arrested a 42-year-old Malaysian, who we believe is the ringleader, at a hotel room in Batu Caves,� he said, adding that the man was wanted in connection with six commercial crime cases.

A 19-year-old Myanmar labourer, who was found with him, was arrested on the spot.

Their two accomplices, believed to be a Bangladeshi and a Myanmarese, escaped.

Last month, the mutilated bodies of two kidnapped Bangladeshi workers were found in a jungle near Genting Highlands.

One of the victim�s family members in Bangladesh had paid RM27,000 for his release but the culprits demanded for RM50,000.

Prime suspect of Faridpur kidnapping arrested
Detectives in Faridpur yesterday evening arrested Syed Masum, the prime suspect in kidnapping five youths of the district.

Dadon Fakir, officer-in-charge of Bhanga Police Station, confirmed the arrest of Masum, member of a local crime gang known as Welcome Party.

Rubel, 18, Belayet, 23, Kaiyum, 32, Sobhan, 19, and Fayez, 23, were abducted from Maligram Bazar of Bhanga upazila in the district on December 6.

On Thursday, Rafiqul Islam, nephew of Rubel, at a press conference said one Nirob of Algadia village under Nagarkanda upazila called Sobhan over the phone around 2:30pm on December 6 and asked the 19-year-old to go to Maligram Bazar.

Mass kidnapping as wave of attacks hits S Russia
More than 10 people have been kidnapped in the volatile province of Ingushetia in southern Russia, a local official said yesterday, as guerrilla attacks by rebels in the region intensify.

In other apparently unrelated attacks across Russia's restive North Caucasus region, a soldier and the wife of a local official were killed, while at least 14 Russian officers were injured, Russian news agencies reported Friday.

The soldier died when the military vehicle he was riding in was hit Thursday by a roadside bomb in Chechnya, which has been ravaged by wars between Russian forces and separatist rebels since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Human rights groups say violence by Islamist fighters and separatist rebels in this mostly Muslim part of southern Russia has reached unprecedented levels since the end of major combat operations in Chechnya several years ago.

In Dagestan, another high-risk Russian province next to Chechnya, four police officers were injured by a bomb blast on Thursday in the city of Khasavyurt, RIA Novosti news agency reported, quoting local police.

Brokers feast on passport-seekers
Kabir Mia yesterday went to the Agargaon passport office to get his MRP but he instead ended up being detained for forgery and handed over to the Rapid Action Battalion.

The passport office suspected Kabir of committing forgery when it found his application form to have been filled out with information similar to the application of Shaheb Ali Sharif, from Kashiani upazila of Gopalganj.

According to Kabir, he was a tea vendor from Nabinagar upazila of Brahmanbaria and became a victim of deception by brokers who had promised to help him migrate to Malaysia.

Kabir talked to a local man, Atiqur who was already working in Malaysia.

Atiqur made an agreement with him that he would help Kabir get a student visa to Malaysia for Tk 3.20 lakh.

Kabir was advised to meet Tanim in Dhaka to get a machine readable passport (MRP).

He then met the broker, from Dhaka's Lalbagh area, and gave him Tk 15,000 for the passport.

Tanim, however, rejected these claims of Kabir when he was sharing his story with The Daily Star at the Agargaon office.

He will then arrange my student visa.�

Tanim had introduced Kabir to another broker Parvez, from Jatrabari area.

The brokers filled out the application form for Kabir's passport and submitted it to the Jatrabari passport office on February 12.

On the delivery date, officials at the Jatrabari office told him that he would have to contact the main office over his passport.

DIP official Nupur confirmed that the genuine passport holder, Shaheb Ali is now staying in Malaysia.

A team of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested Redwanul Azad Rana, a key member of banned militant outfit Ansarullah Bangla Team, at Uttara in the capital on February 20.

He had managed to get a passport with fake information and fled to Malaysia in February 2014 to evade arrest in connection with the killing of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, police said.

RAB DETAINS THREE

Meanwhile in another development, Rab detained three members of a gang involved in making fake passports and visas in the capital's Jatrabari on Sunday night.

UAE expatriates urge Bangladesh to combat passport, visa forgeries
The UAE-based Bangladesh Business Council (BBC) yesterday urged the government to fast resolve the issue of

fake identification documents, so that UAE could resume issuing visas for Bangladeshi nationals.

Earlier in August, UAE imposed stringent measures because of the increasing number of Bangladeshis migrants.

Many had fake documents, expired passports and visas, which are considered by UAE as a security threat.

On Thursday, the Gulf nation temporarily suspended issuing entry permits to Bangladeshi nationals over the matter.

In each of the last eight months, some 25,000-30,000 Bangladeshi workers left for the UAE, according to data from the labour and employment ministry.

�The government should take special initiative regarding UAE's security concern, as it is the second largest market for Bangladeshi workers,� said Mohammad Mahtabur Rahman, president of BBC, while adding that workers could check online whether their visas are legitimate or not.

Jasim Uddin, first vice-president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), urged the UAE government to withdraw its sanction.

Rahman said UAE can become a route for the re-export of Bangladeshi goods to Arab and African regions, citing the country's jute exports to Iran.

Iran was one of the major buyers of Bangladeshi jute products before international sanctions on the country.

�There is scope to use the regular shipments made from Dubai to Iran for the re-export of jute products.�

He suggested the Bangladeshi readymade garment exporters explore the markets in the African and the MENA regions using Dubai, to diversify their markets from Europe and USA.

The MENA region refers to the Asian countries of Bahrain, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the UAE and Yemen, and the North African countries of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.

Rahman also pointed out that Bangladeshi businessmen in Dubai are eager to invest in the country, but the government has to entice them with incentives such as five-year tax exemption for new investments.

The UAE became the second largest importer of Bangladeshi goods last fiscal year.

In recent times, several such frauds -- (a) misappropriation of Tk.622 coroes by one Nurunnabi in Chittagong in 2007 through a false local letter of credit, (b) embezzlement of Tk.596 crores withdrawn without cheque from Oriental Bank in 2006 (alleged Hawa Bhaban connection), and (c) transfer of Tk.300 crores by forgery from five banks by one Om Prokash in 2002 -- were not as heinous as bank defrauding.

Most alarming has been the abandonment in 2009 of the time honoured and most effective practice of promoting the Deputy Managers (DGM) of the NCBs and DFIs through competitive selection process led by Bangladesh Bank.

Thus, the Bangladesh Bank exercise of an independent committee preparing unified fit list for promotion to General Manager's position has been replaced by a parochial, particular bank based, promotion by the respective Board of Directors of an NCB or DFI.

There is an ongoing debate as to which of the concerned organs of the state, the government, Bangladesh Bank or Sonali Bank, is mainly responsible for the Hall-Mark scandal.

But an immediate need is replacing reactivity to the crises by a proactive strategy of anticipating and guarding against the loopholes and an agile system of inspection by Bangladesh Bank.

The recommended inspection although orally approved by the MD in January could not be started until April allegedly due to resistance of a DMD.

If it was under duress from its Board or the powerful politicians, an MD or DMD worth her / his salt should have handled it firmly within the framework of law unless she / he was a party to the loot.

On paper, the Board of the bank is responsible for policy formulation and the management headed by the MD is responsible for managing the affairs of the bank under the law, rules, regulations and policy decided upon by the Board.

Why has the Bangladesh Bank recommended dissolution of the Sonali Bank Board for the Hall-Mark scam only two weeks before its expiry!

Bangladesh Bank's capacity for effective, objective, transparent and accountable bank supervision may be enhanced, including enlargement of professional staff, extension of its authority over the NCBs and adoption of a separate pay scale;

4.

The writer is a former Governor of Bangladesh Bank.

Pakistani caught with forged Indian rupees




Detectives early yesterday arrested a Pakistani woman from Shahjalal International Airport and seized fake Indian currency amounting to Rs48,00,000 from her possession.

Police claimed she is a member of an international counterfeit currency ring, which uses Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan as smuggling routes.

A Dhaka court placed the forgery suspect on a three-day remand for grilling after police produced her before the court.

Law enforcers also produced her before the media in the afternoon at the media centre of Dhaka Metropolitan Police.

Talking to newsmen, she denied her involvement in the crime claiming an unknown person had requested her to carry the luggage and hand it over to a man in Dhaka.

Naz has come to Dhaka from Pakistan via Abu Dhabi to elude the police intelligence unit, said Mohammad Shahidulla, senior assistant commissioner of DB.

She came to Bangladesh three times since 2008, went to Nepal twice and Bhutan once.

According to detectives, fake Indian currency is produced in Pakistan and smuggled into India through Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.

The quality of the counterfeit notes produced in Pakistan is far better than those produced in Bangladesh, maintained Shahidulla.

�The circulation of fake Indian notes is widening recently as the monitory transaction soars for purchase of sacrificial animals on the eve of Eid-ul-Azha.�

Naz's husband Karim Mohammad Nur Ali, also a key member of the gang, is now in Bangladesh and was supposed to receive her at the airport.

Karim is an accused in two cases filed in connection with recovery of forged currency in Dhaka.

US swimmer Ryan Lochte banned 10 months
US swimmer Ryan Lochte has been hit with a 10-month suspension following his bogus gunpoint robbery story during a drunken night out at the Olympics, two separate media reports said Wednesday.

Lochte, 32, has been suspended until mid-2017 the USA Today newspaper reported citing a person with knowledge of the situation.

A United States Olympic Committee (USOC) spokesman declined to confirm the reports when contacted by AFP for comment.

USA Today said a statement confirming the suspension would be issued on Thursday.

He was charged by Brazilian police last month of making a false report about being robbed at gunpoint during a night out.

The tale humiliated first the Brazilian hosts of the Games and later Lochte's own Team USA, after police determined that he had largely fabricated his story.

It says it has passed on its finding to the Swiss police.

Esquivel, the former president of the Federaci�n Venezolana de F�tbol, the Venezuelan football federation, was extradited to the United States in March.

Land Grabbing Case: Ragib Ali sent to jail
Industrialist Ragib Ali was sent to jail yesterday in two cases filed for forging legal papers and grabbing the endowed land of Tarapur Tea Estate in Sylhet.

After being arrested by the Karimganj district immigration police of India yesterday morning, the fugitive was handed over to Sylhet police around 2:30pm, said Sugyan Chakma, additional superintendent of Sylhet police.

In the evening, he was produced before Sylhet Additional Metropolitan Magistrate's Court.

After the hearing, the court rejected his bail petition and sent Ragib to jail, said Misbah Uddin Siraj, public prosecutor of Sylhet court.

Sugyan said Ragib's visa to stay in India expired on 10 November and yesterday he went to Karimganj immigration police office for his visa extension.

The immigration police held him there and handed him over to Sylhet police.

Ragib, prime accused in the cases, along with his son Abdul Hai fled to India on August 10 after Sylhet Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court issued arrest warrants for Ragib and five others, including his son, in two cases filed in connection with grabbing the land of Tarapur Tea Estate, which is an endowment property.

Fake currency gang busted
Detectives picked up six suspected members of a forgery gang and seized fake currency notes worth Tk 1.2 crore in the capital's Mirpur on Monday.

Speaking at a press conference at the DMP media centre, Joint Commissioner Monirul Islam of the Detective Branch of DMP said the six were held in different areas of Mirpur.

A case was filed with Mirpur Police Station in this connection.

About 70,000 people have obtained the certificates, although their names are not included either in the "Red Book" or the Indian government's list, according to sources in the Liberation War Affairs Ministry.

The Indian government in 1973 had sent a list of 69,509 freedom fighters who received training in that country.

He said they would check the names that were not included in the Red Book or the Indian government's list.

In 1999, during the AL government, the count rose to 1.54 lakh.

According to the Bangladesh (Freedom Fighters) Welfare Trust Order, 1972, a freedom fighter is a "person who served as a member of any force engaged in the war of liberation but shall not include the serving members of the defence services, police or the civil armed forces, or any government pensioner, or any other person having any regular source of income."

ACC's Assistant Director Moazzem Hossain held Inamul Haque, former assistant vice-president of Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd, and its former investment in-charge Shamsuddin, and proprietor of Three Star and Co MA Mannan for taking Tk 12.13 crore in loan against fake documents.

According to the case statement, one Ali Hossain is the owner of 1.5 katha plot at Mirpur Section-11.

The accused, Mannan, in collaboration with Al-Fattah Habibullah, managing director of development company Urban Skyline Ltd, forged the signature of the land owner and mortgaged the land to the Islami Bank's Bangshal branch with the help of Inamul and Shamsuddin, the statement said.

Tahsinul Haque, deputy director of the anti-graft body, filed a case against five people in this connection with Bangshal Police Station on June 6 this year.

ACC's Assistant Director Rizia Khatun arrested him from Police Line Gate in Rajshahi.

ACC's Assistant Director Hafizul Islam held Shampa Rani Shaha, secretary of New Prime Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd, from Faridpur in a graft case filed against her on January 7, 2015, for misappropriating Tk 1.14 crore.

In another development, the ACC caught two former union parishad members Azizur Rahman and Abul Kalam Azad of Shyamnagar in Satkhira for embezzling Tk 85,500 from a rural infrastructure development project of 2002-03 fiscal without doing any work.

Assistant Director of ACC Shamim Iqbal arrested them from Shyamnagar.

"Tesco has in principle reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the UK Serious Fraud Office regarding historic accounting practice," the supermarket giant said.

25 Dubai shops caught for illegal money transfer to Bangladesh
Authorities in Dubai of United Arab Emirates unearthed 25 local shops linked to an illegal money transfer racket which they said had lured Bangladeshi expatriates.

The transfers were done through SIM cards from Bangladesh installed in electronic devices and no invoices were issued to customers.

First of all, none of the shops had money transfer as permitted activity in their licences and they didn�t have the mandatory approvals from the UAE Central Bank,� said Lootah.

Lootah added that such practices are harmful not only to the UAE economy and local businesses but also to people tricked by such offers.

Hackers steal $100m from BB account
Bangladesh Bank has identified the people involved in the hacking of around $100 million (Tk 780 crore) from its foreign currency account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, claim BB officials.

Almost the entire amount was transferred online to the Philippines banking system and a small portion of it to Sri Lanka by suspected Chinese hackers on February 5, they said.

The incident took place at a time when Bangladesh's banking system is trying to recover from the recent ATM and credit card fraud.

A senior BB official told The Daily Star yesterday that a small portion of the stolen money has already been recovered from Sri Lanka.

But the money, which is in the Philippines, is yet to be recovered.

Nearly one-third of the reserve is in the form of liquid assets with the Federal Reserve Bank in the US and the Bank of England.

�Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) is working with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) of the Philippines to recover the money from there,� it said.

The AMLC filed a case in this regard in the Philippines, and received a court order to freeze the accounts of those involved in laundering the stolen money.

Wishing anonymity, a deputy governor of the BB, said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York failed to do due diligence in dealing with the hacking threat.

"To date, there is no evidence of any attempt to penetrate Federal Reserve systems in connection with the payments in question, and there is no evidence that any Fed systems were compromised," said New York Fed spokeswoman Andrea Priest in response to queries about the claim.

I just saw the news in the media,� Muhith said after a meeting with the newly appointed country director of the World Bank in Dhaka.

According to BB officials, hackers stole the money from a BB account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on February 5.

But the issue came to the fore after inquirer.net, a leading news website in the Philippines, revealed that the funds laundered were of a financial institution in Bangladesh.

Now the financial regulator of the Philippines is investigating what could be the biggest money laundering case ever detected in the country.

Investigators in the Philippines found that computer hackers stole around $100 million which was brought into the country's banking system.

�We are confident of recovering the funds as it was channelled into the Philippines financial system,� said a senior BFIU official.

�Two of our officials recently visited the Philippines to hold talks on the issue,� added the official.

In a statement, Bangladesh Bank said it is working to repay the money the cardholders lost as a result of the fraud.

Moreover, to protect customers, we blocked all the cards that were used in the suspected two ATM booths in Gulshan area,� said Ziaul Karim, head of communication of EBL.

Kazi Saifuddin Munir, managing director of IT Consultants Ltd that owns Q-Cash, the country's biggest payment processing consortium, said the incidents that took place on Friday were not the first ATM frauds in Bangladesh.

This time, the bank has lost $250,000 (Tk 2 crore) to cyber-crooks, who allegedly hacked into the bank's security system and transferred the money to an account in Turkey.

The crime was committed in September last year while Sonali Bank's corporate branch at Shilpa Bhaban was transferring the amount to the United Kingdom through wires on behalf of its client in Bangladesh.

But the money was stolen by London-based hackers, who reportedly transferred it to Turkey.

M Aslam Alam, secretary at the banking and financial institution division, disclosed this at the annual conference of Sonali Bank at Sonargaon Hotel in the capital yesterday.

An official of the state-run bank was suspended for alleged involvement in the cyber-theft following a Bangladesh Bank probe.

Now, Sonali Bank is trying to retrieve the money with the help of Bangladesh Bank.

�We have written to the central bank of Turkey, seeking help for getting back the money,� a senior Bangladesh Bank official told The Daily Star.

Early this year, miscreants robbed more than Tk 16.4 crore from the Sonali Bank's Kishoreganj branch, which was set up at an insecure location.

At yesterday's conference, Aslam made a mention of the January 24 bank robbery and an incident of trespass on the bank's head office at Motijheel during a Hefajat-e Islam rally on May 5 last year.

Bangladeshi banks and business houses are now exposed to the risk, as they are gradually computerising their systems.

According to a recent research by Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management, much of the technology-based fraud was done through mobile-banking and plastic card transactions.

JP candidate Fakhar-uz-Zaman and AL candidate HN Ashiqur Rahman are contesting for Rangpur-5 constituency as the two parties failed to settle grand alliance candidature for the seat.

When contacted, Fakhar-uz-Zaman said, "The arrestees are not activists of Jatiya Party and none of the party in Mithapukur has any connection with the leaflets and letters that police seized."

AL candidate HN Ashiqur Rahman said, "The fake letters and leaflets were published and distributed to deceive the voters."

Goldman Sachs accused of fraud




The US government on Friday accused Wall Street's most powerful firm of fraud, saying Goldman Sachs & Co sold mortgage investments without telling the buyers that the securities were crafted with input from a client who was betting on them to fail.

The complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan "undermines their brand," said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Goldman critic.

Typically, cases are resolved by firms agreeing to a settlement before the charges are made public, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University.

A team of capital's Mirpur police along with Sadar police raided their residence in Harinkhana area in the city in the early hours and arrested them.

AIG to pay $725m to settle fraud case

Fraud alert from Libya
Bangladesh embassy in Libya has asked for stringent government measures so that illegal manpower syndicates cannot send jobseekers to that country.

The embassy sought such steps as it learnt that illegal syndicates have become active to send Bangladeshi workers to Egypt and Sudan with tourist visas, and then push them into Libya, official sources said.

Libya could be a very important labour market for Bangladesh.

But any sort of illegal practices in sending manpower to that country might ruin the scope to utilise this opportunity, said Ahsan Kibria Siddiqui, first secretary (labour) at the Bangladesh mission in Tripoli.

Besides, it sought that the Bangladesh mission in Egypt request the authorities in Egypt and Sudan to check illegal entry of any Bangladeshis to Libya.

After a nine-month civil war in Libya, local and foreign companies are in the process of resuming their operation to rebuild the country.

They are now seeking to re-employ foreign workers on a very limited scale, and regular recruitment of workers will take a few more months, officials at the expatriates' welfare ministry said in Dhaka.

Since the civil war began in February this year, over 36,000 Bangladeshi workers returned from Libya.

Presently there are around 10,000 Bangladeshi workers in Libya.

According to a recent letter to the expatriates' welfare ministry from the embassy in Tripoli, housing companies mainly employ Bangladeshi workers.

Both local and foreign companies have huge amounts of money due from the Libyan authorities before the civil war.

�Therefore, before beginning fresh work, these companies are seeking their dues and compensation from the Libyan government,� says the letter.

And they (embassy officials) are now very careful about recruitments in Libya as many of the companies had earlier failed to pay the dues of foreign workers including those from Bangladesh.

Contacted, Begum Shamsunnahar, joint secretary at the expatriates' welfare ministry, said an inter-ministerial taskforce is already keeping a close watch on the airports, and also on the recruitment agencies so that none can illegally send workers to Libya.

Woman beaten by fraud manpower agent's gang dies
A middle-aged woman severely beaten up by a manpower agent and his henchmen succumbed to her injuries at Dhaka Medical College Hospital yesterday after fighting for her life for 19 days.

The deceased was Shahana Begum, 48, wife of Abdul Barek of Hizla Kanargaon in Keraniganj and mother of Mohammad Selim.

Manpower agent Iqbal of neighbouring village Bhawal Manoharia and his gang ruthlessly beat Shahana Begum at her house on November 27 as her son Selim tried to recover Tk 6.5 lakh from the agent after he [Iqbal] failed to send him to Italy.

Following the incident Shahana Begum was rushed to Mitford Hospital and then to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where she died yesterday at 6:00pm.

Rezaul said Selim gave Iqbal Tk 9.5 lakh in 2008 as he [Iqbal] convinced Selim that he [Iqbal] could make arrangements for sending him to Italy within 40 days of getting the contract money.

A case was filed on that very day with Keraniganj Police Station in this connection but none was arrested yet, said police.

Not so SWIFT
Two engineers of SWIFT have come to Bangladesh to review its servers with the central bank -- 38 days after a band of hackers breached the payment system in an attempt to steal about $1 billion.

The Bangladesh Bank asked SWIFT Global to review its system in Bangladesh as soon as it found out about the security breach on February 7.

Finally, last Thursday, two engineers -- one from SWIFT's office in Hong Kong and the other from Kuala Lumpur -- arrived in Bangladesh.

Headquartered in Belgium, SWIFT Global provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardised and reliable environment.

After harvesting credentials for ten days, on February 4 around midnight, the hackers broke into the BB's SWIFT servers and generated 35 payment orders for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The FBI has already started its work in Philippines, through which $81 million of the stolen money were laundered.

An abode for stolen cattle
Twenty one cattle were recovered from an underground cowshed at the house of a suspected thief in Nilphamari's Horinchara Koimaripara village in Domar upazila on Saturday.

A few days ago, the thieves stole a milking cow from the house of one Mosharaf Hossain of Koimari village in nearby Jaldhaka upazila.

The victim filed a case with Jaldhaka Police Station in this connection.

Later, a case was filed with Domar Police Station in connection with the incident, said the SI.

A Dhaka court yesterday placed each of the three -- suspended GM Meer Mahidur Rahman and two suspended deputy general managers (DGMs) Sheikh Altaf Hossain and Shafizuddin Ahmed -- on a 12-day remand in two cases filed in connection with the Hall-Mark loan scam.

Sources said many people left the country with those passports posing as Bangladesh government officials.

The committee also observed that the massive forgery was possible due to serious mismanagement and dominance of brokers at the Agargaon passport office.

Although the committee submitted its report to the DIP Director General NM Zeaul Alam, he is yet to send it to the home ministry for further procedure.

Turkey informed the Bangladesh foreign ministry in April that it had detained three Bangladeshis who were carrying the Bangladesh government employees' passports even though they were not government employees.

Hasan Ali, manager of a Rajshahi Krishi Unnyan Bank branch in Lalmonirhat, was arrested from Fakirer Tokeya in the district for embezzling Tk 4.41 lakh in the name of disbursing crop loans among farmers.

Mobarak Ali Kha, acting chairman of Monirampur union in Jessore, and Mizanur Rahman, of Monirampur upazila, were held from Jessore for misappropriating VGF rice, and Arifur Rahman, of Kalihati upazila in Tangail, was caught from Sylhet's Golapganj for taking his job by giving fake address.

Bahar Uddin, a deed writer at Sylhet Sadar Sub-Registrar office, was held from Sylhet for pocketing Tk 6.95 lakh by making fake land documents.

Akram Hossain, of Alfadanga upazila in Faridpur, was nabbed from Faridpur for making fake land documents by using forged signatures of Alfadanga upazila UNO, land surveyor and land officer (kanungo).

ALLEGATION AGAINST TWO DIP OFFICIALS

Scam hits Basic Bank
Taking out loans with forged documents is so easy in Bangladesh that fraudsters don't want to miss out on any opportunity.

A Bangladesh Bank inspection found many irregularities in four branches of state-owned Basic Bank -- Motijheel, Shantinagar, Dilkusha and Gulshan branches -- that involved loans of nearly Tk 4,424.93 crore between December 2009 and November 2012.

Of the amount, Tk 1,594.73 crore was given by the Gulshan branch, and majority of the loans was issued without proper scrutiny.

Though Bangladesh Bank first came to know about massive irregularities in Basic Bank in September 2011, it did not take any regulatory action against the people responsible.

Washington 'forged' nuclear documents: Ahmadinejad
Documents revealed last week that appear to show Tehran is working on a nuclear bomb trigger were "forged" by Washington, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has told a US news network.

"They are all fabricated bunch of papers continuously being forged and disseminated by the American government," Ahmadinejad told ABC News in an interview aired Monday when asked about the confidential documents first revealed in London's The Times newspaper.

Describing charges that Iran's is continuing work on a clandestine nuclear weapons program as "a repetitive and tasteless joke," Ahmadinejad said the reports were about a nuclear trigger were "fundamentally not true."

US President Barack Obama's senior advisor David Axelrod said Sunday that any accusation of Washington fabricating documents was "nonsense."

"Nobody has any illusions about what the intent of the Iranian government is," Axelrod told ABC's "This Week."

Ahmadinejad told AFP on Friday that Iran was ready to strike a uranium enrichment deal if the United States and the West respect the Islamic Republic and stop making threats.

Of the 13.26 crore active connections in Bangladesh, 11.6 crore were re-registered, 40-50 lakh of which were done with forged biometric details, said senior executives of different mobile operators.

Acknowledging it as a serious problem, a high official of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they are discussing the issue with the operators to find a solution.

He also warned me not to tell it to others,� said Abul Khair of Baliadanga village under Kaliganj upazila.

�The next night I received the call again and he told me to go to an old temple at Nabinagar Bilen village in Dhaka district with Tk 16 thousand 5 hundred 51 as at least two goats will have to be sacrificed to please ziner badsha.

The callers asked me to meet with ziner badsha at the shrine of Shah Sultan at Mohasthangarh in Bogra with the money.

Eager to perform Hajj with ziner badsha, Abul Khair managed the money and told the caller to come to his house as it was difficult to go to Bogra with the amount.

Human hauler driver Hafizur Rahman of Chhoto Ghigati village under Kaliganj upazila said, �Saying that I would be rich, some young men cajoled me into giving them Tk 1 lakh 20 thousand that I managed by taking loan from NGOs and selling cattle and ornaments.

Later, I got the cheat arrested by Rab but I am yet to get back the money.�

Atiar Rahman, headmaster of Talshar High School in Kotchandpur upazila also received calls from a young man introducing himself as ziner badsha.

Mukaddis Hossain, headmaster of Khashraninagar government primary school in Shailkupa upazila, said a woman introducing herself as an official of a cellphone company told him that he had won Tk 51 thousand 5 hundred in a lottery from their office.

The caller told me go to Rajshahi with Tk 44 thousand 5 hundred 65 that day to get the lottery money,� said Shahidul Islam Jhantu of Shisharkundo village under Kotchandpur upazila.

Villagers at Kaunia in Rangpur on Friday beat up and handed over to police one Matiur Rahman after he cheated three people of Tk 2 lakh 20 thousand in the name of making them rich with the help of ziner badsha.

According to a Bangladesh Bank release, the compensation will be paid at a function at the central bank where the deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Nazneen Sultana along with top officials of EBL will be present.

Bashundhara chairman sued for 'fraud'
A Dhaka court yesterday summoned the chairman and managing director of East West Properties Development Ltd, a concern of Bashundhara Group, and three others to appear before it on February 20 on fraud charges.

Metropolitan Magistrate Hasibul Haque passed the order hours after North South University Chairman Mohammad Shahjahan filed a case accusing four including Ahmed Akbar Sobhan Shah Alam, chairman and MD of the housing company, of embezzling Tk 2.63 crore.

Later, he obtained bail from the High Court.

A Dhaka court yesterday placed them on a four-day remand.

Credit card fraud is common in developed countries, particularly in the US and in Europe, where scammers use spy ware or other mechanisms to obtain a credit card's details, which they use to withdraw money through a duplicate credit card.

There are examples of credit card fraud in India and other Asian countries.

But the UCB case is the first such instance in a bank in Bangladesh.

2 jailed for DU admission fraud
A mobile court today sentenced two students to one month�s jail for their involvement in fraudulent activities during an admission test of the Dhaka University.

Salam was caught at Sher-e-Bangla Government Girls� High School centre while he was using mobile phone to receive answers from outsiders during the admission test, acting proctor of DU MA Amzad told reporters.

Another candidate, Jubaidul Islam was detained from Motijheel Government Girls� High School over the same charges, he added.

The DU proctorial body also detained two former students of DU near the Central Shaheed Minar last night for their alleged involvement in cheating in the undergraduate entry tests of the university, he added.

Destiny MD among 65 charged for fraud
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) today pressed charges against 65 accused including Destiny Group managing director Rafiqul Amin and its director Lt Gen (retd) Harun-or-Rashid in two cheating cases.

ACC Deputy Director Mozahar Ali Sarder and its Assistant Director Tawfiqul Islam submitted the charge sheets to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court of Dhaka this afternoon.

Tan, who is also the president of the Bankers Association of the Philippines, explained that an institution would have �poor� processes if it did not have the right checks and balances and internal control processes.

�Bottomline is, it will not be easy to have zero instances but you can prevent the number of instances or the impact of the instances.�

On February 5, some $81 million in dirty money stolen by computer hackers from the Bangladesh central bank entered the Jupiter branch of RCBC and found its way to local casinos, which are not covered by reporting obligations under the Philippine anti-money laundering law.

Conventional theory states that the international syndicate that planned the Bangladesh cyber heist chose the Philippines as destination of the dirty money because casinos are not covered by reporting obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA).

Suspected thief beaten to death
A suspected thief was beaten to death allegedly by some night guards at Mirpur in the city early yesterday, said Pallabi police.

On information, police recovered the body of the unknown youth aged around 32 from a lane beside Baitus Salah mosque at section-6 in Mirpur around 6:30am.

Nazneen Sultana, deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, handed over the reimbursement.

This was the first time such an incident happened in Bangladesh.

They have brought those to Bangladesh from abroad, dodging the vigilance of law enforcement agencies.

Seven of the foreigners are Cameroon nationals while two others are from Congo.

The rest is Bangladeshi.

Seven Cameroon citizens are Abdou Nassara, Jean Claude, Gonou Desire, Mimba Serges, Kambiwa Dieu Nedort, Moguem Solo and Tiadeu Barnard while two Congo nationals are Ngonga Diasonama Merlin, and Mutombo Nzail Yousouf.

The Bangladeshi is Mare Moyna Poroi Taylor.

The special force, however, did not go into detail about the Bangladeshi's role in the criminal activities.

The frauds are Samapta Gyne, 19, son of Sukurmar Gyne and Reazul Islam, 22, son of Anwarul Islam of Narail Sadar upazila, and Ashraful Islam, 21, son of Shahidullah of Narsingdi.

HSTU authorities later handed the three over to Dinajpur Police Station, said Redwanur Rahim, officer-in-charge of the police station.

Although the number of attacks in Bangladesh has fallen, the area is still listed as very high risk, he said inaugurating a daylong ICC workshop on 'International Fraud-prevention, Control & Remedies' at the Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre organised for the bankers in cooperation with Mutual Trust Bank Ltd, said a press release.

�We have asked banks to check their ATM booths to see whether there is any skimming device to steal the customers' information or not.�

ATM theft is increasingly becoming a common crime, with fraudsters entering the booths of different banks with fake ID cards and introducing themselves as IT experts of the banks.

Of the 56 banks operating in the country, 48 are connected with the NPS, according to Bangladesh Bank.

But we have stopped transactions through the NPS,� said Abul Kashem Mohammad Shirin, deputy managing director of Dutch-Bangla Bank that has the largest network of ATM booths in Bangladesh.

In recent times, several such frauds -- (a) misappropriation of Tk.622 coroes by one Nurunnabi in Chittagong in 2007 through a false local letter of credit, (b) embezzlement of Tk.596 crores withdrawn without cheque from Oriental Bank in 2006 (alleged Hawa Bhaban connection), and (c) transfer of Tk.300 crores by forgery from five banks by one Om Prokash in 2002 -- were not as heinous as bank defrauding.

Most alarming has been the abandonment in 2009 of the time honoured and most effective practice of promoting the Deputy Managers (DGM) of the NCBs and DFIs through competitive selection process led by Bangladesh Bank.

Thus, the Bangladesh Bank exercise of an independent committee preparing unified fit list for promotion to General Manager's position has been replaced by a parochial, particular bank based, promotion by the respective Board of Directors of an NCB or DFI.

There is an ongoing debate as to which of the concerned organs of the state, the government, Bangladesh Bank or Sonali Bank, is mainly responsible for the Hall-Mark scandal.

But an immediate need is replacing reactivity to the crises by a proactive strategy of anticipating and guarding against the loopholes and an agile system of inspection by Bangladesh Bank.

The recommended inspection although orally approved by the MD in January could not be started until April allegedly due to resistance of a DMD.

If it was under duress from its Board or the powerful politicians, an MD or DMD worth her / his salt should have handled it firmly within the framework of law unless she / he was a party to the loot.

On paper, the Board of the bank is responsible for policy formulation and the management headed by the MD is responsible for managing the affairs of the bank under the law, rules, regulations and policy decided upon by the Board.

Why has the Bangladesh Bank recommended dissolution of the Sonali Bank Board for the Hall-Mark scam only two weeks before its expiry!

Bangladesh Bank's capacity for effective, objective, transparent and accountable bank supervision may be enhanced, including enlargement of professional staff, extension of its authority over the NCBs and adoption of a separate pay scale;

4.

The writer is a former Governor of Bangladesh Bank.

The Detective Branch of Police on Tuesday night busted a gang of four fraudsters for stealing around Tk 2 crore from automated teller machines (ATM) of different banks in Dhaka in the last two years.

Rab personnel detained three persons at Uttara in the capital in April this year for burglary and fraudulent use of credit cards.

DB police last month arrested two persons for their involvement in credit card fraud in Dhaka.

One of them is an IT expert, who was educated in England.

However, many such cases have gone unreported, as Bangladesh Bank, the regulator of the country's banking industry, has no mechanism to get information on this type of fraudulence.

Bangladesh is a cash-based economy, and the use of plastic cards is a new phenomenon.

They sometimes enter ATM booths of different banks with fake ID cards, and introduce themselves as IT experts of the banks.

�Fraudulence can take place even at the stage of issuing and acquiring cards [during purchase],� said Masrur Arefin, deputy managing director of the City Bank, the second largest credit card provider in Bangladesh after the Standard Chartered Bank.

Malaysian experts warn of fraud, abuse again
The plan to export manpower to Malaysia under private management without a strict monitoring system may create room for abuse and exploitation of overseas job seekers, as seen in the past, warned labour rights activists.

Malaysia last month announced that 15 lakh Bangladeshis would be recruited in the next three years under B2B (Business-to-Business) agreements.

"However, this initiative only involves fresh workers from Bangladesh.

Illegal Bangladeshi immigrants working here are not involved and we will continue to deport them," Malaysian Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was quoted as saying by state news agency Bernama on June 26.

"The B2B is again going to be a disaster like what we recently witnessed in the sea and on the Thai-Malaysian borders," said Aegile Fernandez, director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian rights watchdog.

The abusive practices that forced Bangladeshi workers to beg on Malaysian streets in 2007-08 would be repeated if workers are hired without a proper assessment of Malaysia's requirements and a system to ensure zero cost migration for the workers, she said.

Labour migration from Bangladesh to Malaysia under private management has always been marred by corruption and serious labour exploitation, which resulted in repeated bans -- in 1997, 2001 and 2009 -- since manpower export to the country officially began in 1992.

During 2006-08, official migration cost was fixed at Tk 84,000 but researchers found that one had to pay more than Tk 2 lakh to go to Malaysia.

The extra money, realised from the migrants illegally, would be distributed among brokers, agents and a section of corrupt officials in Malaysia.

Many bogus companies in Malaysia had hired workers and abandoned them or confined them to rooms or had often forced them to work with very low wages.

In 2013, Malaysia started recruiting Bangladeshis under Government-to-Government (G2G) arrangements but only for the plantation sector.

While more than 4 lakh Bangladeshi workers went to Malaysia between 2006 and 2008, only some 10,000 workers were hired under the G2G system since 2013.

"It's a huge question why Malaysia allowed hiring of Bangladeshi workers under the G2G system only in the plantations.

Also, why did Malaysia offer jobs only to 10,000 Bangladeshis in more than two years if it required 5 lakh a year?� said Harun Al Rashid, regional coordinator of CARAM Asia, a Malaysia-based regional network of civil society organisations in Asia.

Hiring migrant workers under the B2B would only benefit the employers, labour agents and suppliers, said Dato' M Ramachelvam, chairperson of Migrants, Refugees & Immigration Affairs Committee at Bar Council of Malaysia.

Besides, no assessment had been made to determine how many migrant workers Malaysia needed at the moment and so the announcement of hiring 15 lakha Bangladeshis was just ridiculous, he said.

If Malaysia really needs foreign workers, it should first legalise the illegal migrants instead of deporting them since they are already skilled and can be more productive than the fresh ones, Ramachelvam observed.

"So, the G2G in Malaysia cannot be termed a failure and this option should be kept open even if migrant workers are hired through private sector," he said.

'Thief' beaten to death
An alleged thief was beaten to death at Dakshin Amgram village in Rajoir upazila early Monday.

The latest addition to the list is Premier Bank, from where a gang pocketed Tk 40 lakh by cloning credit cards issued by Al Rajhi Bank of Saudi Arabia, sources said.

�There are more banks that have fallen victim to the recent card frauds,� Shubhankar Saha, executive director and spokesman for Bangladesh Bank, told The Daily Star on Thursday.

Police have so far arrested four people in this connection -- one Ukraine-born German national and three officials of City Bank's card division.

It is believed that fraudsters stole data of around 7,000 cards used in four ATMs of City Bank, EBL and UCB in Dhaka early last month.

Ecuador opposition candidate alleges fraud
Right-wing opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso alleged fraud in Ecuador's presidential runoff election, vowing to contest results that had his rival Lenin Moreno extending a decade of socialist rule.

The election is being closely watched as a barometer of the political climate in Latin America, where more than a decade of leftist dominance has been waning.

It may also decide the fate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in Ecuador's London embassy since 2012.

"Starting today, Ecuador has a president who is going to promote national unity," countered Lasso in a speech to his own supporters.

In Latin America, where a so-called "pink tide" of leftist leaders has been ebbing, the vote is seen as crucial.

Argentina, Brazil and Peru have all shifted to the right in recent months, as the region has sunk into recession and leftist leaders have been tarnished by a string of corruption scandals.

United opposition

Boosted by high prices for its oil exports, Ecuador registered solid economic growth averaging 4.4 percent per year during the first eight years of Correa's presidency, before tipping into recession in mid-2015.

Assange wades in

In another of the race's hot issues, Lasso threatened to revoke the political asylum Ecuador has granted its most famous guest, Assange.

Correa, an outspoken critic of the United States, let the WikiLeaks founder stay at the London embassy to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden over a rape allegation.

Assange waded into the electoral fray Sunday, congratulating Moreno and tweeting: "I cordially invite Lasso to leave Ecuador within 30 days (with or without his tax haven millions)."

That was a reference to WikiLeaks's accusation that Lasso is linked to the Panama Papers tax haven scandal.

Assange, who denies the rape accusation against him, says he fears Sweden wants to send him to the United States to face trial for leaking hundreds of thousands of secret US military and diplomatic documents in 2010.

The 45-year-old Australian's case has returned to the spotlight since WikiLeaks was accused of meddling in the US election last year by releasing a damaging trove of hacked emails from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign and her Democratic party.

West Ham targeted in tax fraud probe
British and French authorities launched a major investigation on Wednesday into a suspected �5 million tax fraud in the football industry, with West Ham United confirmed to have been targeted.

"HMRC has arrested several men working within the professional football industry for a suspected �5 million ($6.4 million, 5.9 million euros) income tax and National Insurance fraud," British tax authority HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) said in a statement.

"180 HMRC officers have been deployed across the UK and France today.

"Investigators have searched a number of premises in the northeast and southeast of England and arrested the men and also seized business records, financial records, computers and mobile phones.

"The French authorities are assisting the UK investigation, have made arrests and several locations have been searched in France."

British reports said tax officials had searched West Ham's London Stadium in east London.

Both the Premier League and France's Professional Football League declined to comment on the matter when contacted by AFP.

British reports said the investigations were linked to the transfer market and several experts suggested the probes particularly concerned the issue of image rights.

In January, the British parliament's Committee of Public Accounts published a report in which it said rules on image rights were being "exploited" in order to avoid taxes.

West Ham and Newcastle have signed several players from French clubs in recent seasons, with Newcastle at one point dubbed the "French legion" due to the numbers in their ranks.

Could enable fraud like seen at Bangladesh Bank: Cybersecurity expert
Hackers yesterday released documents and files that cybersecurity experts indicated the US National Security Agency (NSA) had accessed the SWIFT interbank messaging system, allowing it to monitor money flows among some Middle Eastern and Latin American banks.

READ ALSO: 'SWIFT is responsible for Bangladesh Bank heist'

The documents and files were released by a group calling themselves The Shadow Brokers.

Shook said criminal hackers could use the information released on Friday to hack into banks and steal money in operations mimicking a heist last year of $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank.

READ MORE: N Korean, Pakistani hackers involved

"The release of these capabilities could enable fraud like we saw at Bangladesh Bank," Shook said.

In a statement to Reuters, Microsoft, maker of Windows, said it had not been warned by any part of the US government that such files existed or had been stolen.

READ ALSO: How millions from the Bangladesh Bank heist disappeared

"Other than reporters, no individual or organization has contacted us in relation to the materials released by Shadow Brokers," the company said.

When cyberthieves robbed the Bangladesh Bank last year, they compromised that bank's local SWIFT network to order money transfers from its account at the New York Federal Reserve.

Since the early 1990s, interrupting the flow of money from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere to al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other militant Islamic groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries has been a major objective of US and allied intelligence agencies.

Mustafa Al-Bassam, a computer science researcher at University College London, said on Twitter that the Shadow Brokers documents show that the "NSA hacked a bunch of banks, oil and investment companies in Palestine, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Yemen, more."

Switzerland's ABB hit by $100m South Korean fraud
Swiss engineering group ABB revealed the discovery of what it called a "sophisticated criminal scheme" in its South Korean subsidiary on Wednesday, which it expects will result in a $100 million pre-tax charge.

"The entire ABB group - all 132,000 of us - will have to live with the consequences," Spiesshofer told staff in a letter after the company said it had uncovered significant embezzlement and misappropriation of funds in its South Korean subsidiary.

The Swiss company said the alleged theft was limited to South Korea, where it employs around 800 people and generated sales of $525 million in 2015.

"The treasurer of the South Korean unit is suspected of forging documentation and colluding with third parties to steal from the company," ABB said.

The treasurer, named by a source in Korea as Oh Myeong-se, disappeared on Feb. 7 and ABB subsequently discovered significant financial irregularities.

"On February 9 we became aware of suspected financial irregularities in South Korea and we immediately launched an investigation," ABB spokesman Saswato Das said.

"Given the size of the scheme, the investigation may expand to third parties inside and outside of ABB in South Korea."

The company's South Korean subsidiary declined to comment.

China bank fraud base found in Japan
The base for a group of people involved in a Chinese version of a bank transfer scam has been found in Japan.

The National Police Agency informed the Chinese Public Security Ministry of the discovery during a regular consultation meeting held in January, according to sources.

The financial damage from bank transfer scams or wire scams in China amounts to 22.2 billion yuan (about �360 billion) a year, about 7.5 times the damage in Japan, according to Chinese authorities.

The scam method is very similar to that in Japan, prompting suspicion that those associated with Japanese bank transfer scam groups spread the method to China.

The NPA intends to increase its vigilance in cooperation with Chinese authorities.

When police officers arrived at the site, about 30 men and women from Taiwan were found in one unit.

Data of documents in Chinese believed to be demand letters used for fraud were also found.

About a dozen of the people found in the unit admitted when questioned by the Fukuoka prefectural police on a voluntary basis that they were making international phone calls from the unit to China attempting to conduct bank transfer scams.

They said they applied to job openings posted in a Taiwan newspaper and entered Japan as tourists.

As they explained, the cell phones contained the history of outgoing calls directed at China.

The prefectural police investigated the case as a suspected bank transfer scam targeting elderly people and others in China.

However, the police faced difficulties in investigations as they could not find sufficient evidence regarding victims in China.

These people have already left Japan, the sources said.

Other bases of groups involved in bank transfer scams targeting China have also been found in places including Spain, Malaysia and Kenya.

In these cases, a number of people from China and Taiwan have been either arrested or deported.

They apparently avoided China as public security authorities there maintain strict surveillance.

In the regular consultation meeting with the Chinese Public Security Ministry in January, the NPA informed Chinese officials of the base in Fukuoka Prefecture and discussed how to handle the case.

If requested by China, the NPA will formally provide such information as phone numbers of the victims and the identities of members of the Taiwan group via Interpol.

The number of bank transfer scams has been rapidly growing in China, with about 600,000 cases having occurred in 2015, about 43 times higher than in Japan.

A typical example is the �It�s me� fraud, where swindlers pretend to be a son or relative in financial dire straits, saying such things as, �I caused financial losses at work,� and �A woman I had an affair with got pregnant.� In addition, there are reportedly many cases where swindlers pretend to be an airline company employee, saying, �Your flight has been canceled, so please make a reservation for another flight.�

�The method is very similar to the one used by Japanese groups,� a senior Japanese investigative official said.

�It is possible that the method was taught by Japanese scam group members.�

'Thief' beaten to death'
A suspected thief was beaten to death by a mob in Sundarganj upazila of Gaibandha early yesterday.

Abul Mohammad Delwar Hasan Inam, officer-in-charge of Sundarganj police station, said Anisur entered the stationery shop of one Nibaran Chandra at Katriyapara village around 2:00am to steal valuables.

Bangladesh Bank, three commercial banks and police analysed video footage of four ATM booths that were skimmed off at least Tk 25 lakh last week.

The foreign national, who installed skimmers at three ATM booths in Gulshan and Banani areas, wore a cap to hide his face.

It appears that another foreigner set up the device at another ATM booth at Kalshi in Mirpur, according to the BB official.

Rafiqul Islam, assistant commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said an initial probe indicated the involvement of a foreigner in installing skimming devices at ATMs.

The bank filed a case with Pallabi Police Station in this regard yesterday evening.

Nazneen Sultana, deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, handed over the reimbursement.

This was the first time such an incident happened in Bangladesh.

'No bar to hijab while using ATM booths'

Read more: ATM frauds rattle banks, customers

The statement was made during a meeting regarding ATM booth on February 17 at Bangladesh Bank.

So, people should not be misled in this regard, said the statement of Bangladesh Bank.

According to Bangladesh Bank, there are over 30,000 POS terminals in the country.

The ATM frauds that took place between February 6 and February 12 shocked people as it was first of its kind in Bangladesh.

Foreign cards that are used for buying goods or services are very vulnerable to frauds,� said Kazi Saifuddin Munir, managing director of IT Consultants that run Q-Cash, the largest private payment switch in Bangladesh.

Customers can lose their personal data and money because their banks have not bothered to adopt chip-embedded cards despite several warnings from the Bangladesh Bank.



City Bank alone had to reimburse its clients around Tk 3 crore for similar unauthorised charges at some POS terminals in Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara and Uttara.

Bangladesh Bank has information that more banks have been affected.

The latest addition to the list is Premier Bank from where criminals pocketed Tk 40 lakh by cloning credit cards issued by Al Rajhi Bank of Saudi Arabia.

Bangladesh Bank had asked the banks to convert to chip cards, also known as EMV cards, at least four times since September 2013.

Only Dutch Bangla Bank has adopted EMV cards.

The BB also directed the banks to get certified by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which is a proprietary information security standard for organisations that handle branded credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB etc.

Established in 1994 by those three founding members, now EMVCo is an international alliance for payment standard by six card networks: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Japan JCB, Discover, and China UnionPay.

China has done it in 2002.

By the end of 2004, almost all credit cards issued in Malaysia had been replaced with chip cards, and POS terminals have also been upgraded to accept chip cards.

According to Bank Negara Malaysia (central bank), for the first half of the year 2005, statistics on credit card fraud showed that the number of cases and losses have declined by 43.2 percent and 33.5 percent respectively, compared with the same period in 2004.

The US was compelled to start using this technology when credit card information stolen from Target, a large chain retailer, in 2013 brought the issue of the vulnerability of credit card information to the front.

Thailand and India which were once havens for card frauds, have mostly introduced EMV-enabled debit cards by 2015.

�Global cyber criminals target non-chip cards and they have found Bangladesh a perfect hunting ground,� said Abul Kashem Mohammad Shirin, deputy managing director of Dutch-Bangla Bank, the first bank to introduce EMV debit card in Bangladesh.

That's why some countries, including Bangladesh, are avoiding the change, they said.

Bangladesh is a late comer in plastic money market.

Can only EMV cards ensure foolproof security to the card users in Bangladesh?

Kabir had filed the case with Gulshan Police Station in July last year.

Meanwhile, another ACC team yesterday arrested Abu Ashraf Siddiqui, assistant director of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), from Ekuria of Keraniganj on the outskirts of the capital on charges of misappropriating money.

Both the arrestees were kept in custody of Ramna police.

Forged visas and misery of jobseekers
NO fewer than 87 Bangladeshi jobseekers were sent back home from Dubai airport on Monday, after the UAE immigration officials found their visas to be forged.

The biggest problem is that the authenticity of the visas issued by the UAE government cannot be verified here in Bangladesh, as only photocopies of the visas are received by the jobseekers.

When Bangladeshi workers are detected with forged visas at a foreign airport, it does little to lift our already sagging image as a manpower exporting country.

11 held over Tk 90cr FDR frauds at Brac Bank
A gang of 11 men has been arrested from a Brac Bank branch in Gulshan in connection with Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs) frauds worth Tk 90 crore, say police and the bank officials.

We suspect they are organised fraudsters,� Abdul Barik, a sub-inspector of Gulshan Police Station, told The Daily Star after primary investigation.

Police said a non-resident Bangladeshi owns the money against nine FDRs, each worth Tk 10 crore.

And, they (officials) immediately contacted the head office (located also at Gulshan 1),� Zara said.

Later, the bank informed Gulshan police who rushed in and picked up the gang members, she said.

BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia�s counsel today placed two petitions before the High Court expressing no-confidence in the judge of a trial court, who is dealing with Zia Orphanage and Zia Charitable Trust graft cases.

On February 25, Abu Ahmed Jamadar, of the special judge court-3 of Dhaka issued an arrest warrant against Khaleda Zia, her son Tarique Rahman and another accused of the cases for not appearing before it in connection with the two graft cases.

Coal scam: Manmohan summoned as accused
Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been summoned as an accused, along with five others, in a case linked to the coal block allocation scam that saw mining rights being assigned allegedly without any transparency to private firms.

A special CBI court has also named Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of aluminium manufacturing company Hindalco, and leading Indian industrialist and former Indian Coal Secretary PC Parakh among the six accused.

Manmohan Singh, who was the prime minister of India for 10 years till his Congress party lost power in May last year, was reportedly questioned by CBI in January in connection with the allocation of a coal field in a coal block in eastern Indian state of Odisha to Hindalco.

The scam, dubbed in Indian media as "Coal-Gate", surfaced after the national auditor's report in 2012 questioned the government's practice of awarding coal mining blocks at a concession to companies without competitive bidding.

US Senator charged with corruption
A top US senator, Democrat Bob Menendez, has been charged with 14 counts of corruption.

The New Jersey politician is accused of using his influence to illegally benefit a Florida eye doctor, who he admits is a long-time friend.

"I am outraged that prosecutors at the Justice Department were tricked into starting this investigation three years ago with false allegations by those who have a political motive to silence me," Menendez told a cheering crowd of supporters in Newark.

New Jersey's largest newspaper, the Star and Ledger, has called on him to resign his Senate seat.

In recent years, the senator has been an outspoken critic of President Barack Obama's policies relating to Iran and Cuba.

He is considered one of the most influential Hispanic American lawmakers in Congress, and is the lead author of legislation that would tighten sanctions imposed against Iran.

Dr Melgan attracted more attention last year when government data revealed that he had received more money from Medicare reimbursements in 2012 than any other doctor in the US.

Menendez has admitted to taking multiple trips to the Dominican Republic on the doctor's private jet and initially failed to properly pay for the trips.

Later, his office admitted to another flight on the jet - from Florida to New Jersey in 2011 - and said that the senator had repaid Dr Melgan for it.

Pont, who is currently running a pace foundation in India, has lost job offers and endured whispers about his honesty since reporting attempts to fix a match in the Bangladesh Premier League and then working closely with ACU officers to bring the perpetrators to justice.

His compelling evidence - evidence that includes audio recordings of individuals detailing exactly how matches would be fixed - was largely disregarded by a tribunal in Bangladesh because they erroneously - and almost inexplicably - concluded that salary paid to him during the sting operation was somehow associated with match-fixing.

The money was part of his agreed salary from Dhaka Gladiators in the 2013 BPL tournament and he was cleared, by the ICC's ACSU, to keep it.

The ICC expressed itself "surprised and disappointed" last February when only Shihab Jishan Chowdury, a co-owner of Dhaka Gladiators, was found guilty of 'being party to an effort to fix' a match against Chittagong.

"It all started on February 1 2013 when Jishan Chowdury, one of the owners of the Dhaka franchise, and one other man came to my room in the evening," Pont said.

Jishan then told me they wanted to fix the game against Chittagong Kings the following day.

He also told me that Chittagong were not involved in the fix.

The death of Bob Woolmer, when Pakistan coach, during the 2007 World Cup has always hung heavily over the game.

A jury in Jamaica eventually returned an open verdict as experts argued over whether he had died from natural causes - he suffered from an enlarged heart and diabetes - or whether he had been murdered by organised crime groups involved in cricket corruption.

Who knows what happened to him that day in Jamaica?"

In the end, I spoke to Peter and decided that, for the long-term good of cricket, really, I should stick to the plan and stay in Bangladesh to see it through.

The Bangladesh tribunal later made strong criticism of the ACSU's decision to allow a BPL game to go ahead even though they had strong suspicions that fixing would occur in it.

I remember one of the Chittagong players said 'you could have made it less obvious' as we shook hands at the end.

Recently, the offer of a lucrative coaching job in India was suddenly rescinded and, as things stand, it is doubtful that the ECB would dare to consider him for the role of England fast bowling coach - a job for which Ottis Gibson, who travels with the squad to the West Indies next month, is now in pole position.

I've lost my job at Dhaka as a consequence, even though I coached them to the title for two years in succession.

Her book is primarily on Afghanistan's governance failures and their effects on the Talabization of the country.

It also has chapters on Egypt, Tunisia, Uzbekistan and Nigeria, among others.

Mired in graft, many countries of Africa, Asia and former Soviet Union, are caught in a Mafia-like system in which money flows upward.

The variations range from military-kleptocratic complex in Egypt to bureaucratic kleptocracy in Tunisia, the post-Soviet kleptocratic autocracy in Uzbekistan and the resource kleptocracy in Nigeria.

The Arab Spring, Chayes contends, �amounted to mass uprising against kleptocratic practices.� The book singles out a few characters like Hosni Mubarak's son Gamal, who crystallised popular revulsion, because he and his cronies 'hijacked' the Egyptian state, �rewriting the laws, awarding themselves privileged access to land and other public resources.�

The effect of such kleptomania is religious extremism.

For example, according to Chayes, among the Nigerian Christians and Muslims, the �puritanical focus on personal behaviour has increased in recent decades, as corruption metastasized beyond the confines of officialdom to infect nearly all Nigerian behaviour.� In Uzbekistan, where Chayes says the aging dictator's eldest daughter is involved in faux charities, telecom sector bribery and possibly even sex trafficking, many people are disenchanted and turning to religion.

According to Chayes, the government of Afghanistan �could best be understood not as a government at all but as a vertically integrated criminal organisation whose core activity was not in fact exercising the functions of a state but rather extracting resources for personal gain.� As a result, Chayes quoted a local human rights activist as saying: �People are becoming more devoted because they are more and more frustrated with the government.

They are turning to God for recourse.�

Faced with such a kleptocratic, criminal empire in Afghanistan, Chayes tried to convince the senior officials at ISAF and the U.S Joint Chiefs to do something about the danger it poses.

Their response was, �First let's establish security, then we can worry about governance.� But, according to Chayes, in Afghanistan, corruption and social injustice are the main causes of insecurity.

But I didn't (she admitted) make the case sufficiently enough for people to change the policy.�

In the same interview, Chayes described her experience of giving a talk in Germany in 2010, where she characterised the Afghan government as a vertically integrated criminal organisation: �I thought that was a wonky throw-away line, and I got a standing ovation!

She points to the fraudulent 2009 Afghan elections, which so frustrated citizens that the vote may have boosted support for the insurgency.

We too have serious graft and corruption problems in Bangladesh.

In announcing his exit, the 79-year-old Swiss has called an extraordinary Fifa congress "as soon as possible" to elect a new president.

Blatter was re-elected last week, despite seven top Fifa officials being arrested two days before the vote as part of a US prosecution.

He added: "The next ordinary Fifa congress will take place on 13 May, 2016 in Mexico City.

Fifa was rocked last week by the arrests on charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering as part of a US prosecution that also indicted 14 people.

A separate criminal investigation by Swiss authorities into how the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were allocated is also under way.

Dinosaur 'thief' arrested in Florida
A US man accused of smuggling 70 million year old dinosaur skeletons into the United States, including a toothy relative of the bigger Tyrannosaurus rex, was arrested on Wednesday in Florida, officials said.

Eric Prokopi, 38, was charged with conspiracy to smuggle illegal goods, smuggling into the United States, and selling stolen goods, which carry possible sentences of five, 20 and 10 years in prison respectively.

China was tops when it came to online victims, with 83 percent of Internet users there having been hit by computer viruses, identity theft, online credit card fraud or other crimes, according to a Norton Cyber crime Report.

Brazil and India were tied for second place with 76 percent, while the United States was next in line with 73 percent.

"People resist protecting themselves and their computers because they think it's too complicated," said Anne Collier, co-director of ConnectSafely.org, a US non-profit group that collaborated with Norton on the study.

Outrage over Philippine cybercrime law
A new cybercrime law in the Philippines that could see people jailed for 12 years for posting defamatory comments on Facebook or Twitter is generating outrage among netizens and rights groups.

She emphasised more efficient and effective role of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) to prevent misuse of internet.

Brig Gen Emdad ul Bari, director general of BTRC's systems and services department, said a large chunk of internet users in Bangladesh do not use real IP (internet protocol).

Toufique Imrose Khalidi, bdnews24.com editor-in-chief, moderated the function, while Unicef Bangladesh's Communication, Advocacy and Partnership Section Chief Shima Islam, among others, spoke.

She said Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), the home and information and communication technology (ICT) ministries, cells in the Criminal Investigation Department, Rapid Action Battalion, and detective branch of police worked on cyber crimes separately.

However, Brac's Gender, Justice and Diversity Director Sheepa Hafiza, and Prof Sadeka Halima of sociology and Prof Suraiya Pervin of computer science and technology of Dhaka University, emphasised teaching children on how to use the internet properly.

Mahbooba Panna, deputy secretary, Information and Communication Technology Division; Suparna Roy, local development expert, Access to Information Programme, Prime Minister's Office; Luna Shamsuddoha, chairman of IT company Dohatec; Taslima Miji, chief executive officer of Techmania Dhaka; and Shahana Siddiqui, head of content and communications for www.maya.com.bd also spoke.

To be safe from the danger of cyber crime one should keep in mind the following things:

* To prevent ID theft, one should avoid disclosing personal information (date of birth, bank details) on any web site to strangers.

In Bangladesh, this trend is increasing and threatening to our lives and livelihoods over the years.

Cyber crime
IN today's interconnected world, the use of computers and other hi-tech equipment have paved the way for a new type of crime -- cyber crime.

The US Senate ratified the cyber crime treaty in 2004, and the FBI trained its foreign counterparts to make them more effective partners in the fight against international cyber crime.

The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) of the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice recently indicted a 28-year old Miami man for the largest credit and debit card theft ever prosecuted in the US, with data from more than 130 million stolen credit and debit cards.

.

With warnings that the US is ill-prepared against a cyber attack, the White House recently conducted a study to protect its computer networks against emerging threats from hackers, cyber criminals or other nations looking for its security secrets.

So the threat of cyber crime looms large in Bangladesh with its fast growing internet banking and transmission of valuable data through the worldwide web.

Cyber crime is gaining ground in Bangladesh.

A Daily Star report on September 28 said that a student leader at Pirojpur lured a class X student to a love trap, raped her and recorded it in a cell phone.

This is the second such incident after a gang in Faridpur raped a school girl and recorded the scene and released the footage.

Therefore, Bangladesh needs to be ready to face such threats, as everyone is aware of the harm that computer viruses and hackers can cause.

Bangladesh has achieved some progress in creating a cyber-friendly atmosphere by adopting a number of initiatives.

The Bangladesh Telecommunication Act 2001 has created a powerful

regulatory authority in the telecommunication sector and section 53 of the Act gives the sector ample power to intercept the communication system to stop any sort of unwanted cyber incidents with the use of telecommunication tools in the country.

These are the Information Security Guidelines 2014 and the National Cyber Security Strategy of Bangladesh 2014.

For example, we may speak of establishing a coordinating organisation like the Computer Emergency Response Team-India, CERT-UK or CERT Australia.

In Bangladesh, cyber crimes are referred to BTRC or the CCA.

The IT Act was promulgated in India in 2000 and was amended in 2008 to introduce, inter-alia, CERT-India.

In Bangladesh, the CCA is still in-charge of handling cyber crime cases.

Thus, it is safer and more convenient for us to follow the Indian IT Act amendment procedures and establish Cyber Security Councils and/or CERTs by adding a chapter to the existing ICT Act.

If there were a separate cyber crime unit within the Bangladesh Police, it could be provided with specialised training; furthermore this unit could be equipped with the latest technological tools.

The Bangladesh Police in association with the Australian Federal Police organised the three-day seminar on cybercrime that began at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel yesterday with an aim to share experiences and foster cooperation in combating cybercrime.

Experts from Australia, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Nepal and the host country are taking part in the seminar.

"As of today our capability to fight cybercrime is inadequate," the home secretary said, adding that Bangladesh is trying to formulate a cybercrime law and a draft law is already in the hand.

Australian High Commissioner Douglas Foskett said cybercrime has become an issue of concern all over the world.

As Bangladesh is witnessing a rapid growth in the use of Internet, it needs to prepare to face the threat, he said, adding that Australian Hi-Tech Crime Centre is offering assistance to different countries in this regard.

Quoting the Internet Law News, the speakers said cybercrime has grown to be larger than illicit drug sales worldwide and the analysts estimate that online fraud will bring in US$105 billion in 2007 alone.

It is further estimated that the cost of data loss due to malicious activity will reach US$ 40 billion worldwide.

Deputy Country Director of UNDP Bangladesh Larry Maramis and Programme Manager of PRP Hubert Staberhofer also spoke at the inaugural ceremony.

Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, a global computer security firm based in Moscow, said the online forum appears to be run by a Russian speaking group.

Dedic is short for dedicated, a term used in Russian online forums for a computer under remote control of a hacker and available for use by other parties.

Dhaka seeks int'l help to check cybercrime
Law Minister Anisul Huq yesterday emphasised strengthening the rule of law in cyberspace and sought international cooperation against cyber crimes in Bangladesh.

He came up with the call while addressing a three-day 2015 Octopus Conference on Cybercrime organised by the Council of Europe at Strasbourg, France.

Anisul spoke at the closing session as a designated speaker from Bangladesh on invitation from Gabriella Battani-Dragoni, the council's deputy secretary general, says a law ministry press release.

Later, Anisul had a discussion on Bangladesh's cybercrime issues with Gabriella Battani-Dragoni and other dignitaries, who assured him of extending all sorts of support and cooperation.

Bangladesh police is organising a three-day regional 'cyber-crime seminar' beginning from today in the city aiming at fostering future cooperation among the participating countries and improving capacities to combat such crimes.

Apart from Bangladesh, experts dealing with cyber-crime issues in Australia, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka and Nepal will take part in the seminar to be held at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel.

The Police Reform Programme (PRP) in cooperation with the Australian Federal Police is supporting the seminar, NBK Tripura, also the national project director of PRP, told the press conference.

Cyber crime and Bangladesh




"Though we use the term 'cyber crime' quite frequently, we barely know the definition of it," says Quazi MH Supan, Asst.

Professor at the Department of Law in the University of Dhaka.

But RAB was successful in catching the hackers which proved that Bangladesh was not far behind in catching cyber criminals.

But, there are no militants in the country as the law enforcers are on hot pursuit to eliminate them," he said while addressing as the chief guest at a special meeting on law and order of Habiganj district at the conference room of the deputy commissioner (DC).

Lawmakers advocate Md Abu Zahir, advocate Mahbub Ali, MA Munim Babu and Mizanur Rahman, deputy inspector general of Sylhet range, spoke on the occasion.

BB heist: US senators call for G20 action on cybercrime
Concern among US lawmakers is growing over the February incident in which hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and used the SWIFT banking network to request nearly $1 billion from an account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Six US senators have urged President Barack Obama to prioritise cyber crime at this Group of 20 summit in China, in the wake of the theft of $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank, according to a letter obtained by Reuters.

In the letter sent to the White House ahead of the September 4-5 summit, Sherrod Brown, a senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and five other Democratic senators say they want the US president to press leaders from the world's 20 biggest economies to commit in joint communiques to a "coordinated strategy to combat cyber-crime at critical financial institutions."

Bangladesh supports raising the issue at G20

Zunaid Ahmed Palak, junior minister for information and communications technology, said Bangladesh has supported the raising of the issue at G20.

US expects G20 members to affirm their commitment to fight cybercrime

Copies of the letter from the US senators were also sent to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.

"We strongly urge you to work with your counterparts and prioritise this discussion at the G20 leaders level in September," it said of the summit to be held in Hangzhou, China, adding that "executive leadership circles across the globe" needed to pay more attention to the risks.

The Bangladesh Bank attack and others that have emerged are only some of the threats posed by cyber criminals, the senators wrote.

The use of cell phone, computer and the Internet in Bangladesh is growing rapidly.

The revolutionary changes in the information technology sector by the present government has accelerated significantly the efforts to digitalise Bangladesh.

Some examples of cyber crime in Bangladesh are anonymous death threats to the prime minister through email, hacking website run by law enforcing agencies and defamation of private information of respected and popular individuals of the country in September, 2008.

But RAB was successful in catching the hackers which proved that Bangladesh was not far behind in detecting and catching cyber criminals.

Apart from monitoring and controlling cyber crimes, Bangladesh Computer Security Incident Response Team should take punitive measures against the offenders, and in some cases BD-CSIRT should take action directly against those who engage in carrying out harmful activities or blog against female students, society, state, political and religious beliefs using phone, website and different social networking sites under the telecommunication act.

of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Jessore Science & Technology University.

Women's rights in the cyber space are abused in many ways in Bangladesh and use of internet and mobile phones to stalk, abuse, intimidate and humiliate women is rampant.

Morphing, cyber stalking and cyber pornography including revenge porn are the most common cyber crimes that target women in Bangladesh.

These incidents are becoming alarmingly common even in the rural areas of Bangladesh.

For these reasons we are yet to see in Bangladesh a successful trial of a cyber crime in its true and real sense.

The Digital Bangladesh vision will not achieve its cherished goals if we fail to secure a safe and creative cyber space for our girls.

Bangladesh, USA to jointly work to prevent cyber crime, terrorism
Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu yesterday said Bangladesh and the USA would work together on four major issues, including prevention of cyber crime and terrorism.

�We've agreed that Bangladesh and the USA will deeply work together on tackling cyber crime and terrorism, protecting democracy and ensuring sustainable development,� he told reporters after a meeting with US Ambassador in Dhaka Marcia Bernicat at his office.

In 1820, Joseph-Marie Jacquard, a textile manufacturer of France, produced a loom that allowed the repetition of a series of steps in the weaving of special fabrics.

In Bangladesh, cyber crime incidents took place first on 23 August 2004 by sending E-mail to the Daily 'Prothom Alo' threatening to kill Sheikh Hasina, the then leader of the opposition in the Parliament and two days later another email was sent to the Bangladesh Police Headquarters threatening Khaleda Zia, the then Prime Minister, her elder son and some members of the Parliament.

Legal response to cyber crime in Bangladesh

In order to facilitate e-commerce and encourage the growth of information technology, the ICT Act, 2006 was enacted making provisions with a maximum punishment of 10 years imprisonment or fine up to taka 10 million or with both.

The ICT Act, 2006 as amended in 2013 is obviously a brilliant achievement of Bangladesh in the field of cyber law.

(2) The enactment has a major effect on e-commerce and m-commerce in Bangladesh.

The writer is Assistant Professor of Law, Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT).

Actions that may affect Bangladesh's unity and hinder other countries' security or help and encourage someone to commit terrorist activities would be considered as cyber terrorism, he said.

Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of the citizens of Bangladesh, by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representations insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

73pc women face cyber crime: Tarana
Three out of four women internet users in Bangladesh face cyber crimes but only 23 percent report the abuses to the authorities, said Tarana Halim, state minister for telecom, yesterday.

Bangladesh has a lot to do for ensuring safe internet, Tarana said at the closing session of a two-day workshop on cyber crimes at Le Meridien Hotel in Dhaka.

The Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation, the Telecom Division and the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) jointly organised the programme titled �Digital Bangladesh: focusing on cybercrime, safe internet and broadband�.

Currently, there are 6.67 crore internet users in Bangladesh, according to the BTRC.

Referring to data from the Association of Mobile Telecom Operators of Bangladesh (AMTOB), the state minister said, of the total data usage, 21 percent is used in Facebook, 36 percent in Youtube and the rest 43 percent for other purposes.



Bangladesh is no different.





Therefore, it is imperative now to think seriously the measures and mechanisms that Bangladesh can adopt to combat cybercrimes and to face the challenges of the rapid growth of information technology and internet.



The Information and Communication Technology Act, 2006, as amended in 2009 and 2013, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Act, 2001, the Pornography Control Act, 2012 are major substantive laws.

To adjudicate cybercrimes, there is 'Cyber Tribunal' and 'Cyber Appellate Tribunal' set up in Dhaka.

'Bangladesh Computer Emergency Response Team' (bdCERT), 'Cybercrime Investigation Cell', 'IT Crime Forensic Lab' are set up by the Bangladesh police to fight cyber crimes.

These laws, mechanisms and institutions mainly deal with domestic crimes, and they lack in legal and instrumental capacity to deal with international cybercrimes affecting Bangladesh.

It is very common in cyberspace that a person sitting outside Bangladesh can bring serious damages inside using internet and computers.

So, Bangladesh must be connected with regional and global legal efforts, i.e., treaties, conventions, interstate groups or task forces etc.

Though the Convention is an endeavor of the European Union and most of the ratifying countries are European, many non-European countries have ratified the same, including the USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, South Africa, even Sri Lanka etc.

India is yet to ratify the Convention.

Bangladesh should ratify this Convention as well because the country can engage itself with the developing state of cyber laws in international level.

Ratifying this Convention will help the country to improve and harmonise the national legislations relating to cybercrimes with the international standard and will facilitate Bangladesh and its authorities to have easy access to international authorities to deal with cybercrimes effectively and confidently.

By ratifying the convention, Bangladesh can enforce extradition from any of the ratifying countries without bilateral extradition treaty.

Therefore, it is imperative that Bangladesh seriously considers ratifying the Convention in order to combat cybercrimes effectively.

The probe revealed how brokers had easy access to the passport office at the capital's Agargaon and influence on a section of officials and employees.

They prepared fake no-objection certificates (NOCs) bearing the names, signatures and seals of some officials of different government offices in Agargaon and other parts of the capital and in Faridpur.

For other NOCs, the syndicate used the names of officials at Tax Commissioner's Office-5, Department of Housing and Public Works, Ministry of Shipping, Public Service Commission, Directorate of Customs Intelligence and Investigation, Fire Service and Civil Defence and Divisional Forest Office in Faridpur.

They observed that the massive forgery was possible due to serious mismanagement and dominance of brokers in the Agargaon passport office.

It was the Turkish government who informed the foreign ministry about the matter in April after detaining three Bangladeshi nationals who were carrying the official passports, added the official.

70 freed on fake bail in 5 months
A temporary staff at a Dhaka court sent fake bail orders to Dhaka Central Jail authorities for five months till June to have released at least 70 accused in cases over illegal trade of drugs, and arms and ammunition.

In his confessional statement to a magistrate yesterday, Md Ismail Hossain, an assistant (temporary) at Dhaka Second Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, said he did it all on instructions from Sheikh Mohammad Naim, a peon at the court.

On July 12, Obaidul Karim Akando, an official at the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, filed a case with Kotwali Police Station against the two court staffs over the forgery.

Sources said Nazim submitted a fake 'Power of Attorney' at the District Land Acquisition (LA) Office at Sholoshahar in a bid to draw over Tk 1 crore against 35 Gandas of acquired land.

The land belonging to the successors of late Bazal Ahmad Sawdagar was acquired for developing a housing project Ananya, by Chittagong Development Authority.

Hearing the news of attempted forgery, Mohin Uddin, who has been an expatriate in Saudi Arabia for the last nine years, made a prayer to the District L/A office for holding up the payments of the acquisition money.

The officials of District LA Office held Nazimuddin and handed him over to Panchlaish Police Station after Mohin Uddin flew in to Chittagong and confirmed that the signature Nazim submitted was fake.

But, the 'Power of Attorney' submitted by Nazim did not bear such verifications (seals and signatures from Bangladesh embassy in Saudi Arabia).

On receipt of allegation of forgery, the Dhaka Stock Exchange made such alert.

A faxed letter, which was sent to Munaim A Aziz of Real Options Ltd read: "As per a decision of the finance ministry, you're awarded a membership licence of the Dhaka Stock Exchange.

"The conditions are: Clearance certificate of Tk 22.50 crore from the National Board of Revenue; clearance certificate from Anti-Corruption Commission; depositing Tk 22.50 crore against a code number of 10901-0001-2081 with Bangladesh Bank; and receiving documents of the membership licence from the Dhaka Stock Exchange after submitting money receipt," the letter read.

GSP forgery in RMG export to Europe
A government investigation committee has found several Chinese and Indian companies responsible for exporting products to European countries using fake Bangladeshi GSP (generalised system of preference) certificates.

"As China and India do not get the generalised system of preference facility in European countries, some companies of the two countries try to export products using fake GSP certificates," a member of the investigation team said preferring anonymity.

Bangladeshi companies often failed to utilise the whole GSP facilities due to stringent rules of origin system, he said.

SC lawyer faces music for forgery
The High Court for the first time has directed the Bangladesh Bar Council to cancel enrolment of Supreme Court lawyer MA Hamid for committing forgery in filing a writ petition with the court.

The HC bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik and Md Delwar Hossain gave the orders after reviewing previous records of MA Hamid, who allegedly submitted forged documents to another HC bench.

The court said MA Hamid submitted a fake certificate to another HC bench of Justice AFM Abdur Rahman for having a court order in his favour.

He filed the petition on behalf of Sarwar Jahan, former principal of Sahapara Girls' High School and College at Shibganj in Chapainawabganj and Akhter Hossain, former headmaster of the school.

On May 13, the petition was moved before the HC bench that issued a suo moto contempt of court ruling against four lawyers including MA Hamid for suppressing facts on filing of the writ petition and its rejection order.

He said in the 90s Rajshahi Bar Association barred Hamid from legal practice in the Rajshahi court for committing forgery in moving cases.

Advocate Abdul Baset Majumder, vice chairman of Bangladesh Bar Council, said this is the first time the HC ordered the Bar to cancel enrolment of a lawyer.

Mahmud Hossain told the court that the Rajshahi Bar Association earlier cancelled Hamid's enrolment certificate for committing forgery.

Bangladesh 13th most corrupt country: TI
- N Korea, Somalia most corrupt

- Denmark least corrupted

- Bangladesh 2nd most corrupted in SA

- Govt making graft scenario worse �by clamping down on civil society�

Bangladesh slipped one notch to rank as the 13th most corrupt country in the world, Transparency International today revealed in its graft perception index.

The country�s score remains the same as it was last year � 25 out of 100 � when Bangladesh ranked 14th in the world, TI�s local branch at in a press conference in Dhaka.

Bangladesh shares the 13th place with Guinea, Papua New Guinea, Kenya, Laos and Uganda, the report titled �Global Corruption Perception Index 2015�.

The report said North Korea and Somalia are the worst victims of corruption while Denmark emerged as the country that has the least amount of corruption.

In South Asia, Bangladesh is the second most corrupt country.

In order from least to most corrupted, the standings are: Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Government in Bangladesh is making worse the corruption scenario by clamping down on the civil society, the report said.

We could do better and we have the potential.�

There are many laws and policies in Bangladesh, but there are lacking in the implementation of those, he said during the briefing at the capital�s Dhanmondi today.

2016-01-28 00:00:00+06:00
We can do better
According to the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2015 released by Transparency International (TI) on January 27, 2016, Bangladesh has scored 25 in a scale of 100, same as last year and two points less than 2013.

The upward movement in ranking could be a source of satisfaction if not for the fact that it has happened mainly because all seven countries that couldn't be surveyed have always scored higher than Bangladesh as detailed below.

Once again, Bangladesh is the second worst performer in South Asia, better than only Afghanistan, which has scored 11, ranked 166th, the second lowest globally.

All other South Asian countries � Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal have scored more and ranked higher than Bangladesh in that order.

At the lowest position in the global list are Somalia and North Korea jointly having scored 8 points.

Bhutan has performed best in South Asia having scored 65 and occupied 27th position from top.

India is 76th with 38 points, Sri Lanka 83rd with 37, Pakistan 117th with 30 and Nepal 130th with 27 points.

Except Bhutan, all South Asian countries have scored lower than the global average of 43.

Countries perceived to be least affected by corruption are: Denmark on top for the second successive year having scored 91, followed by Finland (90), New Zealand (89), Netherlands and Norway (87), Switzerland (86), Singapore (85), Canada (83), and Germany, Luxembourg and UK (81).

Other than Singapore, only Japan, Hong Kong, Qatar and UAE have scored 70 or more in the Asian region.

Developed countries like Australia, Iceland, Belgium, Austria, Japan, USA, France, Ireland, Spain and Italy have scored less than 80.

Some developing countries are not the only ones in this category - New Zealand, a consistent top performer, has slipped down the index by three points; Australia, Luxembourg and even the highest ranker Denmark lost 1 point.

Brazil and Lesotho lost a maximum of 5 points.

Countries that have gained most are Kuwait and Rwanda, who went up by 5 points, the Netherlands who went up by 4 points, and Czech Republic, Austria, Namibia and Jordan which rose the ladder by 3 points.

In South Asia, the score of Bhutan and India remain unchanged while that of Sri Lanka, Nepal and Afghanistan declined.

Pakistan's score has increased by 1 point.

No nationally generated data, including Transparency International (TI), Bangladesh's research or that of any other national chapter of TI is considered for the CPI.

Scores are validated by the German Institute of Economic Research, while methodological excellence is ensured by a panel of experts from the Department of Statistics and Political Science of Columbia University, Methodology Institute and the Department of Government of London School of Economics and Political Science, Harvard Business School, Dow Jones, and Standard and Poor's.

Data for Bangladesh came from: Economist Intelligence Unit Country Risk Assessment, World Economic Forum Executive Opinion Survey, Bertelsmann Foundation Transformation Index, Global Insight Country Risk Ratings, Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide, World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, and World Justice Project Rule of Law Index.

To recall, Bangladesh was earlier placed at the bottom of the list for five successive years from 2001-2005.

Somalia has now been ranked at the very bottom for the ninth successive year, which may be a source of relief for us.

In 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, Bangladesh was ranked at nos.

Bangladesh's legal, institutional and policy structures are de jure conducive to good governance and corruption control, though much to be desired de facto.

CORRUPTION HURTS
After experiencing many ups and downs over the last four plus decades, the economy of Bangladesh has transformed into a promising one on many accounts.

Despite being a least developed country, the volatility of long-term economic growth in Bangladesh has been lower than many developing countries.

The impetus of higher economic growth in Bangladesh has come from various enablers, including domestic regulatory policies and global linkages.

A favourable policy environment and continuity of policies have been the key factors behind the strong growth of Bangladesh.

For example, market access by a number of developed countries has boosted readymade garments export from Bangladesh.

Access to the global labour market by Bangladeshi workers has been a source of increased national savings.

For example, the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge has connected the eastern and western parts of Bangladesh.

The use of mobile telecommunication in the development sector has brought spectacular results in remote villages of Bangladesh and helped promote inclusive growth.

Bangladesh scored 25 out of 100, which is the same as that in 2014.

In terms of ranking, Bangladesh's position is 13th from the bottom among 168 countries that were listed in the ranking of corruption.

The first generation economic reform measures in Bangladesh led to the opening up of its economy in the 1990s.

Economic development of Bangladesh has so far been autonomous of governance to a large extent.

Ershad, also a special envoy to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, made the remarks while addressing a biennial council of JP�s Munshiganj unit at the district Shilpakala Academy auditorium.

Experts caution against anomalies
The deal signed by Dhaka and Kuala Lumpur yesterday leaves a legacy of controversies and creates chances of corruption and labour exploitation like that during 2007-08, experts and industry insiders have said.

The agreement for G2G Plus recruitment system has a provision for including a Malaysian private company to regulate the process, which created scopes for monopoly in the hiring of 1.5 million Bangladeshi workers over the next three years, they said.

Apart from that, the minimum wage has been set at Malaysian ringgit 800-900 (Tk 15,000-16,000), which is very low and is a result of poor negotiations by Bangladesh, according to experts.

At the same time, the deal has been signed at a time when the outlook of Malaysian economy is not bright, with its businesses saying there will be oversupply of foreign workers.

Nevertheless, after signing of the deal, Bangladesh's Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment Minister Nurul Islam and Malaysian Human Resources Minister Richard Riot Anak Jaem said it would ensure a �systematic and transparent� recruitment mechanism.

The recruitment will be fair and transparent,� Richard told reporters in Dhaka.

According to an official of Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, the name of Synerflux has not been mentioned in the MoU, and yet Malaysia has authorised the company to regulate the recruitment process through online.

Mohammed Abul Basher, president of Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (Baira), in a letter to the Prime Minister on February 16 said the company through its syndicate members would have scopes to make profits unilaterally, and deceit workers.

Since June last year, other companies like Bestinet and Real Time Networking also lobbied Malaysia and Bangladesh governments to win contract, but finally Malaysia chose Synerflux.

According Malaysian media, Synerflux is owned -- directly or indirectly -- by relatives of a ruling party minister.

Though migration cost in the deal has been set at Tk 37, 000 per worker, it is bound to go up significantly if there is a syndicate of several agencies working from behind, said Professor CR Abrar, who teaches International Relations at Dhaka University and researches migration.

LOW WAGE

When real wage in Malaysia has gone down, Bangladesh has failed to lobby for higher minimum wages for workers.

He thinks the syndicate led by Synerflux is so strong that the Bangladesh government has given in to its influence.

MALAYSIAN ECONOMY DOWN

As Malaysia's economy is now slowing in the face of falling oil prices, real earnings of the Bangladeshis have come down.

Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) President Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said due to the current economic climate �an influx of migrant workers may result in an over supply�.

Mohammad Harun Al Rashid, regional coordinator of Caram Asia, a regional NGO on migration, said thousands of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia were already in problems -- with low-paid jobs or joblessness.

He questioned why a certain company is involved in recruitment from Bangladesh, which is not the case of other labour-source countries like Nepal or Indonesia.

Besides, thousands of low-skilled Bangladeshis were employed in Malaysia in professional categories in the last few years, but most of them are now jobless and undocumented, Harun added.

However, Bangladesh has not sought any clarification from Malaysian authorities, he said, adding: �Thus, we Bangladeshis are losing our dignity in foreign land.�

Bangladesh Awami League arranged the discussion at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre.

Those also addressed discussion were AL Advisory Council Member and Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed, Presidium Member and Agriculture Minister Begum Matia Chowdhury, General Secretary and Public Administration Minister Syed Ashraful Islam and Disaster Management and Relief Minister and Dhaka City AL General Secretary Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya.

Besides, AL Joint Secretaries Mahbub-ul Alam Hanif and Jahangir Kabir Nanak, Organizing Secretary Abu Sayeed Mahmud Al Swapan, Central Committee Member SM Kamal Hossain and Dhaka city AL Vice-President Kamal Ahmed Mazumdar, MP addressed the function.

It was natural to relieve him of amassing wealth beyond known sources in case the allegation was found unfounded, said M Hafizuddin Khan, trustee member of corruption watchdog Transparency International Bangladesh.

ACC filed the case with Shahbagh Police Station on March 6, 2014 on charge of causing the state a loss of Tk 16 crore by allocating seven acres of Rajuk's land to a journalists' cooperative society at a lower rate.

On March 9, the High Court granted bail to Abbas in this case paving the way for his release from jail.

Marcos jewels used to tackle Philippines corruption
A "virtual exhibit" of jewellery once owned by former first lady Imelda Marcos is being used as an anti-corruption campaign in the Philippines.

The jewels were seized by US Customs in 1986 when she and her husband, Ferdinand Marcos, fled to Hawaii after the military leader was overthrown.

The Marcoses were allowed to return to the Philippines when Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989.

Supporters of the charismatic family say the Philippines needs strong leadership to overcome its social and economic problems.

Stay away from corruption
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday asked the new members of Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) to work as public servants and stay away from corruption.

The PM was addressing a programme to distribute certificates among the participants of the 60th Foundation Training Course of Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC) at the city's Bangabandhu International Conference Centre.

�It also happened in Bangladesh for which the country could not move ahead after 1975 [assassination of the Father of the Nation].�

She suggested the officials of various BCS cadres to maintain high standard in implementing development projects and ensure better outcome for the targeted beneficiaries.

The anti-corruption monitoring organisation, which released the study yesterday, said only Italy scored higher than a D in its A-to-F grading for the armed forces of the top troop-contributing countries.

And six countries -- Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Egypt, Morocco and Togo -- received F grades, said the TI.

The three countries -- Bangladesh, Ethiopia and India -- which make up more than one quarter (about 25,200) of all UN peacekeeping troops scored poorly in the rankings.

Bangladesh and India each got a D, and Ethiopia an E.

The TI mentioned poor anti-corruption practices and inadequate training as factors in assessing the rankings.

The most recent catalyst for concern is a sex-abuse scandal that has implicated peacekeepers deployed to the Central African Republic, in episodes dating to 2013, many involving children.

Officials confirm use of bamboo in Chuadanga building
The administration in Chuadanga�s Damurhuda Upazila today said it found to be true the allegation that bamboo sticks were being used as alternative of iron rod in the construction of a government-funded building in Chuadanga district.

Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Faridur Rahman submitted in a written statement to Deputy Commissioner (DC) Chuadanga in this regard.

Another team led by a deputy secretary of the Ministry of Agricultural Affairs reached to Chuadanga today to investigate the matter.

The committee will re-check the report that has been submitted by a three-member committee headed by Soumen Shaha, director of Biological Research Wing of Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Dhaka.

French Tennis Federation offices raided
The French Tennis Federation's offices and the home of its president Jean Gachassin were raided on Tuesday in an investigation into alleged corruption and embezzlement, sources said.

The raid was linked to the alleged illegal sale of tickets for the French Open and the "conditions of awarding of the contract for the extension of the Roland Garros stadium", France's financial prosecution service said.

A travel agency in Tarbes, southern France, was also searched.

The French Tennis Federation (FFT) confirmed that its offices had been raided and said that it was fully cooperating with authorities.

The raid comes after months of rumours about the existence of a ticket sale racket and long-running rows over the expansion of the Roland Garros stadium, where the French Open Grand Slam tournament is held.

In February a French satirical newspaper, Le Canard Enchaine, published an article alleging Gachassin had sold French Open tickets at face value to a travel agent friend who had then sold them on at five times their original price.

France's sports ministry had launched an investigation into such allegations in September 2015.

The FFT has also been rocked by the firing of managing director Gilbert Ysern in February after weeks of disagreements with Gachassin, a move that divided French tennis with top players Gilles Simon and Julien Benneteau backing the ousted Ysern.

That Mrs. Sonia Gandhi has been named by an Italian court in Milan is not something conspirational.

Corruption in all the three neighbouring countries - India, Pakistan and Bangladesh - has become a way of life.

The local bribe-takers have already been punished by the Italian court and they are serving the sentence.

But in India, the guilty are yet to be brought to book.

Why Corruption Matters
Pope Francis has called corruption �the gangrene of a people.� US Secretary of State John Kerry has labelled it a �radicaliser,� because it �destroys faith in legitimate authority.� And British Prime Minister David Cameron has described it as �one of the greatest enemies of progress in our time.�

Corruption, put simply, is the abuse of public office for personal gain.

Indignation at the highhanded behavior of a corrupt police officer helped to drive a Tunisian fruit seller to set himself on fire in 2010, touching off revolutions across the Arab world.

As security expert Sarah Chayes argues in Against Corruption, the volume of essays that the British government will publish to accompany the summit, corruption today is structured practice.

The departments that we spent our careers serving � the US State Department and the US Department of Defence � set great store by building relationships.

The application of the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) Act to indict officers of FIFA, soccer's international governing body, shows how focusing on western service providers can curb corruption among foreign officials.

William J. Burns, former US Deputy Secretary of State, is President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Admiral Mike Mullen was Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.

"My goal is to support the programme of president Gianni (Infantino) and to help football restore its tarnished image," the Senegalese UN diplomat, named Friday as FIFA's first ever female secretary general, told AFP.

"And to those who speak of my lack of experience, I say give me the time to prove myself," she added in a telephone interview from Abuja, Nigeria, where she is representing the United Nations Development Programme at a summit to discuss efforts to defeat Islamist militant group Boko Haram.

Samoura, who was named as the successor to the disgraced Jerome Valcke at a FIFA congress in Mexico on Friday, will take her post by mid-June after undergoing an eligibility check administered by an independent review committee.

"I was in Madagascar at the time and it was during a match between Madagascar and Senegal," in a qualifier for the 2018 World Cup, she said.

Graft case: HC clears way for Khaleda�s trial
The High Court today cleared the way for a lower court to continue trial proceedings against BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia in Zia Charitable Trust graft case.

On April 17, a Dhaka court rejected the applications of Khaleda after her lawyers submitted those before the court at Bakshibazar in the presence of Khaleda.

The above anecdote testifies how deep institutional corruption has permeated into Bangladeshi culture.

The same point was made by political analyst Zia Hassan on the issue of the Bangladesh Bank 'hacking' incident.

In a status, Hassan pointed out that within two months of the heist, the Philippines had already conducted public hearings in the senate, activated investigative units, frozen suspected accounts, rounded up a witness from an aircraft and recovered USD10 million from a casino.

Even then, few transparent and concrete steps have been taken apart from pointing fingers at the US Federal Reserve or SWIFT.

The rapid growth of the Bangladeshi economy has also been marred by large-scale financial corruption.

See the consequences for yourself: last year, there were reports of at least eight MLM companies still operating in Bangladesh, using a stay order on a government decision (Ittefaq, March-23-2015).

And this is where Bangladesh has been failing again and again.

Detectives arrested Aslam, his driver and one of his accomplices from Khilkhet area in Dhaka on Sunday over the alleged plot to topple the AL government by joining forces with Mossad, Israel's secret service agency.

The ACC also decided to launch an investigation against Mizanur Rahman, proprietor of Moon International, for allegedly embezzling Tk270 crores from the state-run Agrani Bank�s Motijheel branch.

FIFA seeks 2-year ban for former DFB boss
FIFA's ethics committee on Friday recommended a two-year ban from all football activities for Wolfgang Niersbach, former president of the German Football Association (DFB), over an alleged corruption scandal around the right to host the 2006 World Cup.

Niersbach, vice-president of the 2006 World Cup organising committee, is still a member of the FIFA Council, and attended last week's Congress in Mexico, as well as being on UEFA's executive committee.

"It's a matter of honour and defence of my rights to oppose this request with all possible legal means," Niersbach said in an interview with German news agency SID, a subsidiary of AFP.

Niersbach, 65, had resigned from the German federation amid accusations the DFB used a slush fund of 10 million Swiss francs (6.7 million euro, $8 million, according to the exchange rate at that time) in 2000 to buy the right to host the 2006 World Cup finals.

FIFA opened a probe on March 22 targeting six people including Niersbach and Franz Beckenbauer, the German football legend and World Cup organising committee chief, over their roles in the bidding process, amid allegations of bribery.

That report, released on March 4, said it could not rule out that Germany bought votes to secure the tournament, and linked Beckenbauer to a "mysterious" deal with disgraced FIFA official Jack Warner.

On April 17, a Dhaka court rejected the applications of Khaleda after her lawyers submitted those before the court at Bakshibazar in her presence.

Other accused in the case are Khaleda's former political secretary Harris Chowdhury, his assistant private secretary Ziaul Islam Munna, and Monirul Islam Khan, APS of former Dhaka city mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka.

Misbah backs Amir to come good
Mohammad Amir can still become the best bowler in the world despite serving a five-year ban for spot-fixing, Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan's Test captain, opined on Monday (June 27).


During that year's Lord's Test against England, Amir was caught bowling no-balls to order in a sting operation carried out by a tabloid newspaper.

Amir, who served three months in an English young offenders institute, has only played limited overs internationals for Pakistan, but his career could come full circle when the first of a four-Test series against England starts at Lord's on July 14 and Misbah believes Amir, who was one of the hottest properties in world cricket at the time of his ban, has lost none of his skill

"The way he has been bowling, he is there," said Misbah, after Pakistan's training session at Hampshire's Rose Bowl ground near Southampton.

Amir, who in his 14 Tests before the ban took 51 wickets at an average of 29.09, will begin his journey to England redemption with a three-day tour match against Somerset at Taunton starting Sunday (July 3).

"Based on the ongoing investigation, Yahoo believes that information associated with at least 500 million user accounts was stolen," said a statement by the US internet giant in what is likely the largest-ever breach for a single organization.

University of Notre Dame associate teaching professor and data security specialist Timothy Carone told AFP that the Yahoo hack fit the "big picture" when it comes to cyberattacks launched by spy agencies in Russia, China, North Korea or other countries.

Carone described Russia, China and North Korea as the usual three suspects in state-sponsored hacks, but cautioned that allies are not above cyber snooping as well.

The anti-corruption watchdog also detained Hasan Ali, manager of Rajshahi Krishi Unnyan Bank�s Fakirer Tokeya branch in Lalmonirhat, for embezzling Tk 4.41 lakh in the name of distributing crops loan among the farmers, Mobarak Ali Khan, acting chairman at Manirampur Union in Jessore and one Mizanur Rahman for misappropriate food of VGF card holders and Arifur Rahman from Tangail for taking job by using forged documents, the PRO also said.

Ex-Venezuela football official to plead guilty in US bribe case
The former president of Venezuela's football federation is expected to plead guilty to U.S. charges stemming from a bribery investigation involving FIFA, the sport's world governing body, according to court records filed on Tuesday.

Rafael Esquivel, who was also an executive committee member with South American football's governing body CONMEBOL, is set to plead guilty on Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn, becoming the latest individual to admit wrongdoing in the case.

Esquivel, who prosecutors accuse of receiving bribe and kickback payments, was among seven football officials arrested at a luxury hotel in Switzerland in May 2015, as the U.S. Justice Department unveiled the case.

Esquivel, the former president of the Federaci�n Venezolana de F�tbol, the Venezuelan football federation, was extradited to the United States in March.

Former South Africa test player Alviro Petersen was recently charged with contriving to fix domestic Twenty20 matches last year and was provisionally suspended from all cricket activities by Cricket South Africa.

FIFA scandal: Argentine firm agrees to $112.8 mn settlement
Argentine sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias S.A. agreed Tuesday to pay $112.8 million to settle charges in the United States stemming from a massive FIFA corruption scandal, authorities said.

Torneos "admitted to its role in the 15-year scheme, including its role in paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to a high-ranking FIFA official to secure his support" for broadcast rights to the 2018, 2022, 2026 and 2030 editions of the World Cup, the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement.

"Today's announcement marks another important step in our continuing effort to root out corruption in international soccer and sends a clear message that corporate entities that rely on the US financial system to enrich themselves through bribery will be held to account," said US Attorney Robert Capers.

US prosecutors accused 40 officials and marketing executives of soliciting and receiving tens of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks in a case that sparked an unprecedented crisis at FIFA.

Only five defendants are left under house arrest in the United States, facing a trial that a federal judge has recommended should begin in New York late next year.

The US investigation rocked FIFA to the core and ultimately led to the downfall of its former president, Sepp Blatter, who is serving a six-year ban from football over ethics violations.

Public hearings can fight corruption
Bangladesh is a lower middle-income country with a promising and stable economy.

The economy of Bangladesh continues to maintain its sustainable growth momentum with a healthy 7 percent-plus growth rate in FY 2015-16.

The foreign exchange reserve shows a steady increase and the exchange rate of US dollar remains stable.

Building on its social-economic progress so far, the government has taken up multifarious initiatives to elevate Bangladesh to a knowledge-based and technology-driven middle-income country by 2021.

However, despite economic progress, corruption remains a formidable problem in Bangladesh.

According to all major global indicators of corruption, namely Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI), World Bank's Control of Corruption, World Economic Forum's Irregular Payments and Bribes and Fund for Peace's Fragile State Index, Bangladesh finds itself among the most corrupt countries in the world.

In Bangladesh, citizens have to travel long distances, often multiple times, incur high costs and endure considerable delays and hassle to access public services (PMO Bangladesh).

This study is based on the corruption experiences of about 1000 people who participated in 42 public hearings conducted by the Anti-Corruption Commission in collaboration with Transparency International Bangladesh, JICA and the World Bank in 37 upazilas of 36 districts and 5 offices in Dhaka, namely RAJUK, BRTA, Passport, three offices of AC (Land) and three offices of Sub-Registrar and a follow-up of public hearing on RAJUK.

The ACC organises public hearings in collaboration with its Corruption Prevention Committees at the district and upazila levels, and Transparency International Bangladesh and development partners (World Bank, JICA and GIZ).

The Anti-Corruption Commission in collaboration with Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) conducted an information fair and public hearing for the first time in Muktagachha, Mymensingh from December 28-29, 2014.

ATM hackers steal Bt12m in Thailand
Thailand has suffered its first ATM (automatic teller machine) hack, which affected 21 cash machines in Bangkok and other provinces resulting in stolen cash totalling more than Bt12 million, while another 200 ATMs are suspected of having been infected with computer viruses.

Police said the incident involving ATMs at the Government Savings Bank (GSB) earlier this month was similar to hacking attacks in Taiwan and Malaysia, where money was stolen from ATMs after malware was used to trick the affected machines into releasing cash without authorisation.

Ronnadol Numnont, assistant governor of the Bank of Thailand, also said the money in bank accounts had not been affected by the attack.

There was also an ATM hacking attack in Malaysia in 2014, while Taiwan suffered a similar incident last month, said Panya, who added that Taiwanese authorities found that the criminal activity had been carried out by sophisticated experts based in Switzerland.

11 held for FDR forgery
A gang of 11 men have been arrested from a branch of Brac Bank in the capital's Gulshan in connection with a Fixed Deposit Receipt (FDR) fraud worth Tk 90 crore, police and the bank said yesterday.

We suspect they are organised fraudsters,� Abdul Barik, sub-inspector of Gulshan Police Station, told The Daily Star after primary investigation.

Later, the bank informed Gulshan police who rushed there and picked up the persons, she said.

Police said Saiful Islam, a non-resident Bangladeshi, owns the money against nine FDRs, each worth Tk 10 crore.

He is also a former senior vice president of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE).

This is the biggest ever FDR forgery attempt in Bangladesh.

About 18 others are now in custody for quizzing in this regard, Biplob Kumar Sarker, police deputy commissioner (Tejgaon), said in a press briefing held at his office this afternoon.

After detentions yesterday, police went up to Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) and called up the authorities at Airtel office in this regard.

13 held for admission forgery at DU, JnU, CU
At least 13 aspirants who sat for today�s admission tests of Dhaka, Jagannath and Chittagong universities were detained for illegally using electronic devices and forgery at different exam centres.

During Dhaka University�s �Gha� unit tests, seven applicants were found using mobile phones and other electronic devices at different examination centres in the capital, DU Proctor M Amzad Ali told The Daily Star.

A case was filed against them with Sutrapur Police Station, he added.

Besides, a mobile court sentenced an applicant to six months in jail for his involvement in fraudulent activities during �B� unit entry test of Chittagong University (CU), said CU Assistant Proctor Liton Mitra.

The Detective Branch of Police on Tuesday night busted a gang of four fraudsters for stealing around Tk 2 crore from automated teller machines (ATM) of different banks in Dhaka in the last two years.



DB police last month arrested two persons for their involvement in credit card fraud in Dhaka.

One of them is an IT expert, who was educated in England.

However, many such cases have gone unreported, as Bangladesh Bank, the regulator of the country's banking industry, has no mechanism to get information on this type of fraudulence.

Bangladesh is a cash-based economy, and the use of plastic cards is a new phenomenon.

They sometimes enter ATM booths of different banks with fake ID cards, and introduce themselves as IT experts of the banks.

�Fraudulence can take place even at the stage of issuing and acquiring cards [during purchase],� said Masrur Arefin, deputy managing director of the City Bank, the second largest credit card provider in Bangladesh after the Standard Chartered Bank.

Amid the allegation of digital forgery in the admission test of Chittagong University (CU) �C� unit under the Faculty of Business Administration, the university authority yesterday postponed the admission test's viva voce exam without mentioning any specific reason.

�I couldn't trace the anomaly during the exam, but afterwards I noticed all the correct answers were slightly blurred,� said examinee Himel Barua, hailing from Khulna.

�If any anomalies were found in the question paper, stern actions will be taken.�

Meanwhile, protesting the alleged forgery, students under the banner of Pragatishil Chhatra Jote yesterday held a human-chain in front of the CU Central Shaheed Minar, where they urged the authorities concerned to retake the exam.

Five jailed for court order forgery
A Dhaka court yesterday sentenced five people, including a bench assistant (peshkar) of another court, to 14 years' imprisonment each for issuing fake bail orders forging signature of a judge of the latter court.

In 2015, the case was filed against them in connection with releasing 106 accused in 76 criminal cases by the fake bail orders through forging signature of a judge of the Second Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court of Dhaka.

Moreover, he did not include some important persons, including another Bench Assistant Nure Alam of the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court of Dhaka, as witnesses in the charge sheet.

According to the case documents, 106 accused in 76 criminal cases, now pending with Dhaka Second Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, were released from prison in five months following the fake bail orders made by Moslehuddin and Naim.

On July 12 in 2015, Obaidul Karim Akando, an official of the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, lodged a case with Kotwali police against the two court staff -- Moslehuddin and Naim.

Making money thru' credit card forgery
Working with foreign fraudsters, a gang here in Bangladesh has been stealing Tk 50-60 lakh a month from holders of international credit cards by cloning cards.

There Sohel had met US citizen and fraudster Erin Limo, the Rab official said.

Sohel continued with card cloning after returning to Bangladesh.

Staying in touch with Erin and taking in Rana, 24, Sohel started card forgery and identity theft in Bangladesh.

The gang took some dishonest shop owners in Bangladesh onboard.

Rab claimed that Nur e Alam, 45, a trade license department official of Dhaka North City Corporation, used to be the middle man between the fraudsters and the colluding shops.

A week ago, 30 people, including six Bangladeshis, had been arrested at Queens, New York and charged for credit card and identity theft.

He said most of the banks in Bangladesh have already introduced EMV cards, but some banks were yet to do it.

Hackers' bid to steal $870m more foiled
The hackers who stole Bangladesh Bank's money were on their way to pull off a heist of about $1 billion, but the banking system responded in time to stop the transfer of $870 million from the central bank's account with the New York Federal Reserve Bank.

The cyber thieves planned to wire their loot through the Philippines and Sri Lanka.

On February 5, $81 million entered the Philippine banking system and after several layers of transactions made its way out and into Hong Kong.

And $20 million ended up in Sri Lanka.

They then attempted to launder a further $870 million through the same channel, but their plan was foiled after an American bank recalled the transfer order.

The episode of theft from the central bank's deposits with the US Federal Reserve Bank is turning out to be a murky, intricate story, one that traversed at least four countries and involved a host of people -- from higher-ups of a bank to casino officials.

The transactions comprise the largest documented case of money laundering ever uncovered in the Philippines by its regulators, said the Philippine Daily Inquirer.



The chips were then converted back into cash and remitted to accounts in Hong Kong soon after by him.

Her representative said she is now afraid that she will be included in the Filipino central bank's �orange list� of bankers found to have committed violations of important banking regulations, such as the know-your-customer rule under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.

The committee on accountability of public officers and investigation of the Senate of the Philippines is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the matter on March 14.

�Yes, the casinos were part of the chain to transactions in this [suspected] laundering case, but there were several layers in the banking system before that, which should have detected these suspicious funds and stopped them,� a Filipino government official told the Inquirer.

Meanwhile, two BB officials were also reported to have visited the central bank of the Philippines to demand the return of the funds.

US charges China officials over cyber-espionage


The world's top two economies have long been at loggerheads over hacking and China's defence ministry denounced Washington's allegations as "a pure fabrication by the US, a move to mislead the public based on ulterior motives".

"From 'WikiLeaks' to the 'Snowden' case, US hypocrisy and double standards regarding the issue of cyber-security have long been abundantly clear," the ministry said in a statement on its website.

China also summoned US ambassador Max Baucus to lodge a "solemn representation" over the indictment, suspended cooperation with the US on cyber-security issues and banned the use of Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system on all new government computers.







Analysts said the US was unlikely to be able to put the men on trial but the indictments were an attempt to apply public pressure on China over the issue.

US Attorney General Eric Holder called on China to hand over the men for trial in Pittsburgh and said the United States would use "all the means that are available to us" should it refuse.

Liew and his wife started a company in the US in the 1990s and hired a team of ex-DuPont employees to steal DuPont's titanium dioxide trade secrets, the court said in its ruling.

Liew, his company USA Performance Technology Inc and Maegerle sold DuPont's secret recipe to Pangang Group for more than $20m (�12m), the court added.

Liew was taken into custody immediately over fears he could abscond, the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Los Angeles reports.

US Attorney Melinda Haaf said: "As today's verdict demonstrates, foreign governments threaten our economic and national security by engaging in aggressive and determined efforts to steal US intellectual property."

"We will aggressively pursue anyone, anywhere who attempts to steal valuable information from the United States," she added.

Prosecutors have also charged Pangang Group, but the charges stalled after a US judge ruled that prosecutors' attempts to notify Pangang of the charges were legally insufficient, Reuters news agency reported.

US files espionage charges against Snowden

Snowden, who is believed to be in hiding in Hong Kong, was charged with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorised person, said the criminal complaint, which was dated June 14.

The latter two offences fall under the US Espionage Act and carry penalties of fines and up to 10 years in prison.

The charges are the government's first step in what could be a long legal battle to return Snowden from Hong Kong and try him in a US court.

Two US sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was preparing to seek Snowden's extradition from Hong Kong, which is part of China but has wide-ranging autonomy, including an independent judiciary.



There was no immediate response to requests for comment from Hong Kong's security bureau.

Snowden earlier this month admitted leaking secrets about classified US surveillance programs, creating a public uproar.

He disclosed documents detailing US telephone and Internet surveillance efforts to the Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper.

The criminal complaint was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, where Snowden's former employer, Booz Allen Hamilton, is located.

US federal prosecutors, by filing a criminal complaint, lay claim to a legal basis to make an extradition request of the authorities in Hong Kong, the Post reported.

The prosecutors now have 60 days to file an indictment and can then take steps to secure Snowden's extradition from Hong Kong for a criminal trial in the United States, the newspaper reported.

The United States and Hong Kong have "excellent cooperation" and as a result of agreements, "there is an active extradition relationship between Hong Kong and the United States," a US law enforcement official told Reuters.

An Icelandic businessman linked to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said on Thursday he had readied a private plane in China to fly Snowden to Iceland if Iceland's government would grant asylum.

Iceland refused on Friday to say whether it would grant asylum to Snowden.

US files espionage charges against Snowden for leaks
US federal prosecutors have charged Edward Snowden, the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about US surveillance programs, with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in US District Court in Virginia on Friday.

The United States has asked Hong Kong, where Snowden is believed to be in hiding, to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed US officials.

Those leaks were the basis of reports in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post this month.

The documents revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents.

The revelation rocked the Obama administration and US intelligence community, raising questions about secret operations of the NSA and whether the agency was infringing on American civil liberties.

In the interview with the South China Morning Post, he said he plans to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has "faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."

The US signed an extradition treaty with Hong Kong in 1996, just seven months before the then British colony was handed back to Beijing.

Hong Kong's extradition laws had previously been governed by the United States-United Kingdom extradition treaty.

This new treaty established an agreement under Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" that allows Hong Kong autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy.

Bradley Manning convicted of espionage
American soldier Bradley Manning was found guilty of espionage on Tuesday for leaking US government secrets, but he was cleared of the most serious charge that he wilfully helped al-Qaeda.

Tuesday's verdict follows an exhaustive two-month court martial at the Fort Meade military base in Maryland, near the US capital.

The 25-year-old US Army private was working as an intelligence analyst near Baghdad when he was arrested more than three years ago and he has been in military custody ever since.

Lind found him guilty of seven of eight counts he faced under the Espionage Act, including counts of stealing US government property and the committal of computer fraud relating to confidential records.

Manning's disclosures largely comprised US diplomatic cables and classified battlefield reports from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The judgment was greeted with fury by WikiLeaks, which said on Twitter that the court's decision reflected "dangerous national security extremism" on the part of US President Barack Obama's White House.

US likely to charge Assange on espionage soon
A lawyer for Julian Assange, the founder of the WikiLeaks website, said on Friday she expects US prosecutors will indict her client soon for espionage.

The lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, told ABC News in London that a US indictment of Assange was imminent but the report offered no further details or comment by Robinson about why she believed charges were likely to be filed soon.

The US Justice Department has been looking into a range of criminal charges, including violations of the 1917 Espionage Act, that could be filed in the WikiLeaks case involving the release of hundreds of confidential and classified US diplomatic cables.

US Attorney General Eric Holder earlier this week said that prosecutors were looking beyond the espionage law for possible charges.

France top culprit in European industrial espionage
France is the country that conducts the most industrial espionage on other European countries, even ahead of China and Russia, said leaked US diplomatic cables quoted yesterday by Norway's Aftenposten.

"French espionage is so widespread that the damages (it causes) the German economy are larger as a whole than those caused by China or Russia," an undated note from the US embassy in Berlin said, according to a Norwegian translation by Aftenposten.

The Norwegian daily of reference said last month it had obtained all the 250,000 US diplomatic cables WikiLeaks had accessed and would publish stories based on them independently of the whistleblowing website's own releases.

Its yesterday's article based on leaked cables included an October 2009 comment from Berry Smutny, the head of German satellite company OHB Technology, quoted in the diplomatic note.

"France is the Empire of Evil in terms of technology theft, and Germany knows it," a Norwegian translation of Smutny's comment in the cable read.

The small German firm won the bid for the contract over Astrium, a subsidiary of pan-European giant EADS.

A leaked US cable posted Monday by Aftenposten described Franco-German competition in terms of spy satellite development.

The cable said Germany was developing, with the help of the US, its own High Resolution Optical Satellite System (HiROS), despite the objections of France, which is leading pan-European efforts in the field with its Helios satellites.

Hackers steal data from 3 banks: report
A Turkish hacking group has claimed to have hacked three Bangladeshi banks and leaked data in a latest incident that highlighted the vulnerabilities of the banking system.

The banks are Dutch Bangla Bank, City Bank and Trust Bank.

The group also hacked two other banks from Nepal -- Business Universal Development Bank and Sanima Bank, according to US-based DataBreachToday.com, a website that provides news on data breach detection, notification and prevention.

However, officials of the Bangladeshi banks said that no customer credentials were compromised.

Links to the file archives containing data from all the three banks have been posted from a Twitter account supposedly operated by Turkish hacking group Bozkurtlar or Grey Wolves.

The group is known to be one of Turkey's national extremist movements.

In case of Dutch Bangla Bank, the 312 KB archive appears to contain records of customer banking transactions -- either physical or internet banking.

In case of Trust Bank, the file contains two spreadsheets that, among other things, contain user ID, email, username and encrypted passwords.

We are actually putting it in the hands of experts.�

�City Bank has checked 58 data and only found two as its customers.�

He however admitted that the dumping of the data shows the vulnerability of Bangladesh's banking system.

Arefin also said the bank's Indian consultant told the bank that it has become a daily affair in India.

�They make a hue and cry about data leaks and are making opportunities for a number of consulting firms to do business.�

The news of the data leaks came three months after Bangladesh Bank lost $81 million in the biggest ever banking heist in history.

The Turkish hacking group has taken credit for the recent attacks on Qatar National Bank and UAE's InvestBank.

Arrests show US-Russia espionage still active after Cold War
The case reads like a plot from a cheap spy thriller, but analysts say the break-up of an alleged Russian undercover network in the United States shows that espionage remains serious business decades after the Cold War ended.

"Russia is continuing to spy on the US, as other countries which harbour animosity do," said Ariel Cohen, a Heritage Foundation senior research fellow specializing in security issues.

But he said the indictments of the alleged spies "indicate mostly old and sloppy tradecraft, which reads like a parody on (British author John) Le Carre books from the 1970s, agents who are not well placed or tech-savvy."

Because the spy craft appears unsophisticated, Cohen said, "some old timers from the intelligence community speculated that the network is a decoy to mask a much more sophisticated espionage operation in the US."

"I view this as a very sophisticated Russian illegal operation.

Burton said there was "a logical assumption" that more Russian agents and sleeper cells may be operating on US soil and that "one of the results of these takedowns is that you will rattle a few trees that will lead to other people or fill in other parts of other investigations.�

The US Justice Department said the 10 "deep-cover" suspects were held on suspicion of seeking details of US nuclear weapons and foreign policy.

The case nonetheless reads like a work of fiction, with a glamorous Russian female agent, "sleeper" cells and cloak-and-dagger secret drops in public places, as one might expect in the Cold War era, even though that ended with the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991.

But Oliker noted that the case still raises questions about why the network operated in various cities away from the centre of US government.

Pakistan accuses 8 Indian diplomats of espionage
* Pakistan names eight Indian diplomats

* Accused of fuelling instability, sabotage of economic project

* India rejects "baseless and unsubstantiated" allegations

Pakistan today named eight Indian diplomats it accuses of espionage and terrorism, as tension mounted between the nuclear-armed rivals following days of artillery duels and skirmishes on the border dividing the disputed Kashmir region.

The foreign ministry said six Indian embassy staff worked for New Delhi's Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) intelligence agency, while two were operatives for the Intelligence Bureau agency.

Their names were leaked to Pakistani media overnight.

In response, India said it "completely rejected the baseless and unsubstantiated allegations" leveled by Pakistan against officials at its high commission in Islamabad.

Rajesh Kumar Agnihotri, a commercial counsellor, was named by the Pakistan foreign ministry as RAW's station chief in Islamabad.

It accused them of fuelling instability in Pakistan's Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, as well as sabotaging its most vital economic project, the $46-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), involving transport and energy infrastructure projects to link China with Pakistan's coast on the Arabian Sea.

They were also accused of liaising with factions of the Pakistani Taliban and of working to damage Pakistan's relations with western neighbour Afghanistan.

It was not immediately clear if the diplomats would be expelled by Pakistan or withdrawn by India, which condemned the publication of their names and images and called on Pakistan to ensure their safety.

Last week, India and Pakistan both expelled one diplomat from each other's embassies, accusing them of spying.

The foreign ministry also said Pakistan had withdrawn six diplomats from its mission in India after Indian media reported they had been involved in spying.

Vikas Swarup, spokesman of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, told a news briefing that Islamabad had withdrawn its diplomats after some were named by the Pakistani embassy worker that it had expelled last week.

The allegations against the Indian diplomats in Islamabad were "an afterthought and a crude attempt to target these officials for no fault of their own", said Swarup, adding that Pakistan's actions added to security risks in the region.

India summoned the Pakistani deputy high commissioner on Wednesday to express its "grave concern and strong protest" over the denouncement of its diplomats in Islamabad.





Later that month, India said it carried out "surgical strikes" on the Pakistani side of the border, but Islamabad called this a fabrication to distract attention from its continuing crackdown in Kashmir.

India expels Pakistani diplomat for 'espionage'
India today announced it was expelling a Pakistani visa official for suspected spying after he was briefly detained carrying sensitive defence documents, with tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours already running high.

New Delhi police said the official had been recruiting Indian nationals for two and a half years to spy for Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in return for cash.

"Delhi police crime branch has busted an espionage racket run by a kingpin working in the Pakistan high commission," said Ravindra Yadav, joint commissioner of police on crime.

The official, named as Mehmood Akhtar, was detained on Wednesday with documents in his possession on Indian troop deployment along the border, Yadav told a press conference in Delhi.

India's foreign secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar summoned Pakistan's high commissioner to inform him of the decision to expel the official within 48 hours.

"FS (foreign secretary) summons Pak High Commissioner to convey that Pak High Commission staffer has been declared persona non grata for espionage activities," Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said on Twitter.



India blamed militants in Pakistan and said it had responded by carrying out strikes across the heavily-militarised border, although Islamabad denies these took place.

Indian and Pakistani troops regularly exchange fire across the border known as the Line of Control in Kashmir, but sending ground troops over the line is rare.

'Spies' to meet at zoo

Yadav said two Indian nationals from the northern state of Rajasthan were also arrested, and that Akhtar had planned to meet his Indian co-conspirators at the Delhi zoo to exchange the information and cash.

He said Akhtar was carrying maps that showed the deployment of India's Border Security Forces (BSF) and army soldiers.

Pakistan's High Commissioner Abdul Basit lodged a "strong protest" on Thursday with the Indian foreign ministry and said the detention of the official contravened diplomatic conventions, a Pakistani diplomatic source said.

"The High Commissioner denied the accusation and said we (the commission) never engage in activity that is incompatible with its diplomatic status," the source told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The expulsion comes as an Indian soldier died on Thursday from injuries he received during an exchange of fire with Pakistani soldiers across the border.

"A BSF jawan (soldier) was killed today by splinter injuries he received during cross border firing from Pakistan," Indian BSF officer Manoj Kumar told AFP.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned Pakistan since the army base attack that India would push to make it a pariah state, accusing it of being a "mothership of terrorism".

Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from Britain in 1947.

UK spy chief sees growing threat from Russian espionage
Russia is pushing its foreign policy in increasingly aggressive ways including cyber-attacks and espionage, posing a growing threat to Britain and the rest of Europe, the head of Britain's internal intelligence agency MI5 has said.

MI5 Director General Andrew Parker said Russia had been a covert threat for decades, but what differed now from the Cold War era was that there were more and more methods available for it to pursue its anti-Western agenda.

"Russia increasingly seems to define itself by opposition to the West and seems to act accordingly," he told the Guardian newspaper in an interview published yesterday.

Former top China energy chief jailed
The former chief of China's biggest oil firm has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for accepting bribes, state media said.

Jiang Jiemin was previously head of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and its listed firm PetroChina.

Jiang was an ally of former security chief Zhou Yongkang, the biggest official caught in the ongoing corruption crackdown in China.

China has been conducting widespread arrests of both low-ranking and high-ranking officials since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.

One of its biggest hauls was Zhou, the former head of China's Ministry of Public Security, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption in June.

Our correspondent says China's leaders use high-profile cases to prove they are serious about tackling government graft.

-- Punishment to be effective from day of his arrest or surrender

-- Khoka dubs verdict �partial, politically motivated�

Sadeque Hossain Khoka, a BNP leader and former mayor of Dhaka, was jailed for 13 years in his absentia today for amassing wealth illegally and concealing information from the Anti-Corruption Commission.

Judge Abu Ahmed Jomadar of the Special Judge�s Court of Dhaka sentenced him to 10 years� imprisonment for acquiring wealth illegally and three years� for concealing information.

Also READ: Khoka charged with Tk 10cr illegal wealth

While delivering the verdict, the court asked the government to confiscate Tk 10,05,021,832 and a building in Gulshan which he acquired illegally.

Khoka, now staying in the USA for treatment, was earlier shown fugitive and the trial was held in his absence.

�I appealed to the court for time as I am staying in New York for treatment after taking bail from the High Court,� he told The Daily Star over phone today.

It is intended to harass me and tarnish my political image.�

Khoka also said that he will appeal to the High Court after consulting with his lawyer.

Meanwhile, BNP spokesperson Asaduzzaman Ripon termed the verdict �politically motivated and injustice� while talking to journalists at party�s Naya Paltan headquarters in Dhaka.

Video clips made available on the social media shows Shahidul counting notes at his office in Motijheel, bargaining with service seekers over the amount of bribe and putting the cash in his trouser pocket.

Cops wait for HC order copy
The police are yet to receive the High Court directives to take legal actions against a teenage drunk driver who ploughed through rickshaws injuring four people in Gulshan last week.

�We will take all necessary steps as soon as we formally receive the directives,� Deputy Commissioner (media) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) Muntasirul Islam told The Daily Star yesterday.

The High Court on Tuesday asked the police authorities to explain in two weeks why they should not be ordered to take legal actions against Fareez Rahman, the underage driver of the SUV.

The policemen at the scene had said Fareez, nephew of former Awami League lawmaker HBM Iqbal, was racing with another car on a waterlogged Gulshan street and had been drinking.

Giving its ruling on a Public Interest Litigation, the HC further asked why departmental proceedings should not be brought against the officer-in-charge of Gulshan Police Station for not carrying out his duty in this regard.

Minutes after the accident, pictures of cops taking Fareez to Gulshan Police Station hit the social media.

But now one company, Pivothead, is putting superior technology into sunglasses worn by highway patrol officers in places like Austin, Texas.

More importantly the efficiency of the unit has made it appealing to law enforcement agencies, including the police department in Newport Beach, California.

Hackers steal $100m from BB account
Bangladesh Bank has identified the people involved in the hacking of around $100 million (Tk 780 crore) from its foreign currency account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, claim BB officials.

Almost the entire amount was transferred online to the Philippines banking system and a small portion of it to Sri Lanka by suspected Chinese hackers on February 5, they said.

The incident took place at a time when Bangladesh's banking system is trying to recover from the recent ATM and credit card fraud.

A senior BB official told The Daily Star yesterday that a small portion of the stolen money has already been recovered from Sri Lanka.

But the money, which is in the Philippines, is yet to be recovered.

Nearly one-third of the reserve is in the form of liquid assets with the Federal Reserve Bank in the US and the Bank of England.

�Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) is working with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) of the Philippines to recover the money from there,� it said.

The AMLC filed a case in this regard in the Philippines, and received a court order to freeze the accounts of those involved in laundering the stolen money.

Wishing anonymity, a deputy governor of the BB, said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York failed to do due diligence in dealing with the hacking threat.

"To date, there is no evidence of any attempt to penetrate Federal Reserve systems in connection with the payments in question, and there is no evidence that any Fed systems were compromised," said New York Fed spokeswoman Andrea Priest in response to queries about the claim.

I just saw the news in the media,� Muhith said after a meeting with the newly appointed country director of the World Bank in Dhaka.

According to BB officials, hackers stole the money from a BB account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on February 5.

But the issue came to the fore after inquirer.net, a leading news website in the Philippines, revealed that the funds laundered were of a financial institution in Bangladesh.

Now the financial regulator of the Philippines is investigating what could be the biggest money laundering case ever detected in the country.

Investigators in the Philippines found that computer hackers stole around $100 million which was brought into the country's banking system.

�We are confident of recovering the funds as it was channelled into the Philippines financial system,� said a senior BFIU official.

�Two of our officials recently visited the Philippines to hold talks on the issue,� added the official.

Drunken driver injures 28 at US Mardi Gras parade
A pickup truck driven by a man who appeared to be "highly intoxicated" plowed into a crowd of spectators watching the main Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans on Saturday, sending more than 20 people to the hospital, police said.

The truck, traveling along the side of the street open to traffic along the Mid-City parade route, struck three other vehicles, including a dump truck, before veering onto the median where a crowd of people stood watching the procession, according to New Orleans police.

Meanwhile in Germany, a man died and two other people were injured after a 35-year-old German man drove into a crowd standing near a bakery in the southwestern town of Heidelberg on Saturday, but the authorities said there were no indications that it was a terrorist attack.

The German authorities are on high alert after a failed Tunisian asylum-seeker drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin on Dec 19, killing 12 people.

Police play dubious role
Police are playing a dubious role in taking legal actions against Fareez Rahman, a former Awami League lawmaker's nephew whose reckless driving left four people injured in the capital's Gulshan on Monday.

Though a police officer, who had visited the scene immediately after the accident, earlier told this paper that 16-year-old Fareez Rahman didn't have a driving licence and they had found evidence of drunk driving, the officer-in-charge (OC) of Gulshan Police Station yesterday denied it.

If found guilty, the teenage boy may face maximum three years' imprisonment or fine or both, said the lawyer, also editor of Dhaka Law Report.

Thailand drunk drivers face morgue work as punishment
Drunk drivers in Thailand could be sent to work in morgues under a new plan to cut the country's dismal road safety record, officials say.

About 24,000 people die each year on Thai roads, according to the World Health Organization.

Only Libya has a greater number of fatalities per capita from road traffic accidents.

Thailand's annual three-day New Year festival, known as Songkran, sees revellers throughout the country take part in water fights.

Evidence of alcohol found in Gulshan teen driver�s car
Even a day after a reckless underage driver injured four people, neither the victims nor the police took any legal step allegedly under pressure from the "influential family" of the accused, said a senior police official yesterday.

Sixteen-year-old Fareez Rahman, nephew of a former Awami League lawmaker, rammed the sports utility vehicle he was driving into two rickshaws in the capital's Gulshan on Monday afternoon.

Contacted, Assistant Commissioner (Gulshan Zone) Rafiqul Islam of Dhaka Metropolitan Police claimed none of the victims were willing to file a case as "they were content with the treatment costs being borne by the teenage boy's family".

Of the victims, private service holder Mohammad Rafique, 27, who had sustained head injury, underwent a surgery at United Hospital and was not out of danger as of last night, said SI Ferdous Ahmed Biswas of Gulshan Police Station, where Fareez's car was kept.

Ex-Fifa man Blazer details bribes
Former top Fifa official Chuck Blazer admits that he and others on the executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the choice of South Africa as 2010 World Cup host.

The American says he also helped to arrange bribes over the 1998 event.

The admissions come in a newly released transcript from a 2013 US hearing in which he pleads guilty to 10 charges.

The US has launched a wide-ranging criminal case that engulfed Fifa and led President Sepp Blatter to resign.

The US prosecutors last week indicted 14 people on charges of bribery, racketeering and money laundering.

The US justice department alleges they accepted bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than $150m (�97m) over a 24-year period.

Blazer says: "Beginning in or around 2004 and continuing through 2011, I and others on the Fifa executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup."

Earlier on Wednesday, South Africa denied paying a $10m bribe to secure the hosting of the 2010 event.

Other admissions among the 10 charges in the 40-page dossier include US tax evasion.

Federal agents investigating the tax evasion had detained Mr Blazer and he agreed to co-operate in the US investigations.

In addition to the US case, Swiss authorities have launched a criminal investigation into how the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were allocated.

SC scraps Maya�s acquittal in 2007 graft case
The apex court today scrapped a High Court verdict that acquitted running minister and senior Awami League leader Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya in a 2007 graft case.

Now, the High Court will have to go into further hearings in this case, a three-member bench of the Appellate Division chaired by Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha ordered.

On October 27, 2010, the anti-graft watchdog filed a case with Dhaka�s Sutrapur Police Station for amassing illegal property.

Following an appeal of Maya, now the relief and disaster management minister, the High Court on October 27, 2010, acquitted him from the corruption charges.

Now, the apex court has scrapped that verdict and ordered the High Court for further hearing on the appeal filed by the Awami League lawmaker that acquitted him back in 2010.

Niko graft: Khaleda�s trial to continue
The High Court today rejected a petition filed by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia challenging the legality of Niko graft case, clearing the way for her trial in the 2007 case.

The HC Bench of Justice MD Nuruzzaman and Justice Zafar Ahmed came up with the verdict after conclusion of hearing on Khaleda�s petition against the case filed by Anti-Corruption Commission.

The ACC filed the Niko graft case with Tejgaon Police Station on December 9, 2007.

It accused Khaleda and several others of abusing power while she was the prime minister to award a gas exploration and extraction deal to the Canadian company.

Former law minister Moudud Ahmed, former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former acting energy secretary Khandaker Shahidul Islam and Kashem Sharif, vice-president (South Asia) of Niko Resources Bangladesh Ltd, were also sued in the case.

The 79-year-old Swiss was thought to have ended his 17-year reign on 2 June amid claims of corruption in world football's governing body.

But, according to Swiss newspaper Blick, Blatter told a party at a Fifa museum: "I did not resign.

Four days after being voted president, Blatter - who is reportedly under investigation in the United States - said: "While I have a mandate from the membership of Fifa, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football.

In response to Blatter's latest comments, Labour MP Chris Bryant, the shadow secretary of state for culture, said: "Sepp Blatter's antics remind me not so much of the hokey-cokey as Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.

Meanwhile, Blatter may not attend the final of the Women's World Cup in Canada because of the twin investigations into Fifa by American and Swiss authorities.

Writ challenges wheat imported from Brazil
A writ was filed with the High Court today challenging the legality of import and distribution of �substandard� wheat from Brazil worth Tk 400 crore.

Advocate Pavel Miah, a lawyer of the Dhaka Judges Court, moved the petition seeking order on the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to launch an inquiry to find out whether any corruption was committed in the import.

The quality of the wheat was up to the mark when it was tested after being imported from Brazil four months ago, Bangla daily Prothom Alo reported today quoting Food Minister Qamrul Islam.

The petitioner also prayed to the HC to direct the government to test the wheat at Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) and Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) whether it is fit for human consumption.

�The government has imported the substandard wheat from Brazil which is not fit for human consumption,� he said in the petition.

On June 14, Supreme Court cancelled a High Court verdict that acquitted minister and senior Awami League leader Maya in a graft case of 2007.

After Maya appealed against the verdict, the High Court, on February 14, 2008, acquitted him of the corruption charges.

Lawyer Eunus says Maya cannot hold the office of lawmaker and minister under Article 66 (2)(D) of the constitution of Bangladesh.

He said that he will file a writ petition with the High Court seeking necessary directives against Maya if he does not respond to the legal notice within 24 hours.

Vandalism, explosions mark hartal
Rickshaws and buses are seen plying the street in the capital's Motijheel commercial area Sunday morning during BNP-led 18-party alliance enforced hartal (shutdown).

In a bid to keep people off the streets, pickets blasted crude bombs and carried out vandalism in different parts of the capital on Sunday during the BNP-led 18-party opposition alliance-called countrywide daylong hartal.

Violence has been reported from Panthapath, Tejgaon, Mohammadpur, Malibagh, Moghbazar, Rampura, and Shahbagh areas.

A number of handmade bombs were exploded in Adabar area of Mohammadpur, Tejgaon, Shahbagh, Gabtoli and Uttara areas.

They also brought out several processions in Motijheel, Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Tejgaon, Moghbazar, Gabtoli and Jatrabari areas of the capital.

Law enforcers rounded up two activists of Sramik Dal with four crude bombs from Tejgaon area around 8:30am.

BACKGROUND

The alliance and its key component Jamaat-e-Islami have already enforced four nationwide hartals this month protesting �police atrocities� on Hefajat-e Islam activists on May 5 in Dhaka and the capital punishment to Jamaat leader Muhammad Kamaruzzaman for war crimes.

The home minister said the government would not permit any meeting or demonstration in Dhaka for an indefinite period to avoid anarchy.

Barisal top cop suspended for 'bribe collection'
The home ministry has suspended Zillur Rahman, a deputy commissioner of Barisal Metropolitan Police (BMP), for alleged collection of bribe money for promotion.

On the other hand, the Police Headquarters in a press release said the suspended police officer was transferred to the DIG office of Sylhet range.

It is alleged that a section of policemen created a joint fund of around Tk 77 lakh to bribe their superiors to expedite the promotion of 230 Barisal cops.

The bribe fund got exposed; the department earlier suspended 10 personnel of Barisal Metropolitan Police (BMP).

"They were suspended for illegal money collection for promotion," BMP Commissioner Shaibal Kanti Chowdhury said, adding the suspension order reached Barisal from police headquarters on Monday and it was executed the same day.

Of the money, Tk 17 lakh was deposited with a joint account of ASI Anisuzzaman, nayek Kabir Hossain and driver Bablu at a Dutch-Bangla Bank branch in Barisal.

The committee summoned Zillur Rahman, Bablu Jamaddar, Kabir and Monir to Dhaka.

Blatter passionately denied any wrongdoing to German magazine Bunte despite two separate on-going Swiss and American investigations into FIFA.

That decision follows the crisis engulfing FIFA with 18 people indicted in the United States on football-related corruption charges involving millions of dollars in bribes.

But the Swiss said he understands at least some of his critics, but has no time for unfounded, libellous accusations.

She made the remarks while addressing an Iftar programme organised by the Association of Engineers' of Bangladesh (AEB), a pro-BNP professional platform, in Bashundhara residential area in Dhaka, where she also claimed that people have been expecting a change very eagerly.

Referring to the recent media reports on wheat imported from Brazil, the BNP leader said the government is yet to take any initiative against the accused minister.

A 2012 Transparency International Bangladesh report has shown that about TK 22,000 crore is lost annually to bribery and unauthorised payments.

A tribunal will be formed after Eid to try Khaleda,� the minister made the comment while talking to reporters after inaugurating a new building of a school in Mirpur upazila of Kushtia this morning.

IPL- the Indian Problem League?

The Indian Premier League (IPL) has changed cricket forever but it is a tournament that is rarely out of the news.

It has helped turn the sport into a billion-dollar business and has been a huge hit with India's cricket-mad fans.

As the men who run the game in India prepare to meet on Sunday to discuss its future, we look at the history of what some are now calling the Indian Problem League.

The IPL was set up by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as it was worried about the impact a rival tournament, the Indian Cricket League (ICL), would have on its control of the sport.

It is a billion-dollar business in India but it is illegal.

Gurunath Meiyappan is his son-in-law and his company, India Cements, owns the Chennai Super Kings.

Srinivasan was forced to step down as the man in charge of the BCCI by India's supreme court, who described his attempts to cling to power as "nauseating".

The second season of the tournament had to be played in South Africa after the Indian government said it could not provide security as it clashed with the elections .

He is currently living in London and will not return to India as he says he will be killed by the underworld if he comes home.

And a number of players, among them the Indian World Cup winner S Sreesanth, have been banned for their links to bookmakers.

As Mudar Patherya, one of India's leading cricket writers, said recently: "This is India - anything can happen."

That could take some time, as India's legal system is not known for its speed.

Corruption is rife across India.

India also has to deal with its gambling problem.

Until that happens you can expect to see the IPL on the front and back pages of India's newspapers.

Graft hearing: Khaleda may appear before court tomorrow
BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia may appear before a Dhaka court in Dhaka tomorrow for hearing in two corruption cases.

With the absence of a specific criminal law to deal with spot-fixing in India, the cricketers were charge-sheeted for offences under the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the MCOCA.

The court, however, said there was not enough evidence for charges to be framed under the MCOCA, a special law passed by the Maharashtra state government to tackle organised crime syndicates and terrorism which contains far stricter provisions relating to bail and admissibility of confessions compared to the Indian Penal Code

In its reaction to the court's decision, the BCCI said its disciplinary action would remain unaltered.

Graft: ACC prays HC to hear Maya, 5 others� appeal
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) today prayed to the High Court for hearing the pending appeals filed by six accused including Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya challenging their conviction and sentences handed down to them in separate corruption cases.

Khurshid Alam Khan, a lawyer for ACC, made the prayer as the Supreme Court has earlier sent appeals to the High Court for their re-hearing.

The High Court bench of Justice Bhabani Prasad Singha and Justice SM Mozibor Rahman accepted the appeals for hearing.

Khurshid Alam Khan told The Daily Star that the High Court Bench will later on fixed date for hearing the appeals.

On June 14, the Supreme Court scrapped a High Court verdict that had acquitted Maya of the corruption case filed in 2007 during the caretaker government.

Following an appeal filed by Maya, The High Court acquitted him in October 2010.

On the same day, the appellate division sent the appeal of Maya to the High Court for its further hearing and disposal.

The Anti Corruption Commission filed the case against Maya, also ruling AL leader, with Sutrapur Police Station on June 13, 2007 on charge of amassing illegal wealth worth Tk 29 lakh and concealing information about it.

A special judge�s court in Dhaka on February 14, 2008 convicted him and sentenced him to 13 years� imprisonment, fined him Tk 5 crore and ordered confiscation of about Tk 6 crore of his ill-gotten wealth.

He returned home after the AL returned to power through the December 29 parliamentary election.

Later on the High Court following their appeals skipped their conviction and acquitted them from the charges.

Gatco graft case: Order on Khaleda�s pleas Aug 5
The High Court will deliver verdict on BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia�s pleas challenging the legality of Gatco graft trial proceedings on Wednesday.

Khaleda Zia later moved two separate writ petitions with the High Court challenging the legality of bringing the case under emergency power rule and its filling and proceedings.

The High Court bench stayed the trial proceeding of the case and issued separate rules upon the government and ACC to explain why bringing the case under EPR and its filling and proceeding should not be declared illegal.

DMP Gulshan zone Deputy Commissioner Mostaque Ahmed Khan told The Daily Star at the spot that the situation was under control of the police.

Later in the day, NSU authorities, Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), Bashundhara Group authorities held an emergency meeting with the students� representatives at the university�s Proctor�s Office.

Split order on Maya�s legitimacy as MP
The High Court today gave split order on Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya�s legality in holding parliament membership with a conviction in graft case.

The writ petition challenging Maya�s legitimacy as MP was filed by Supreme Court lawyer Eunus Ali Akond on July 7.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the corruption case against him, also ruling Awami League leader, with Sutrapur Police Station in Dhaka on June 13, 2007.

Maya appealed to the High Court against the verdict on February 14, 2008.

Illicit outflows amounting to 1.1 percent of its GDP, 12.7 percent of its tax revenue and $1.31 billion a year between 2003 and 2012 are a stupendous draining of resources from a developing country like Bangladesh which it can ill-afford.

According to a recent report by the Transparency International Bangladesh, people have to pay bribes starting from Tk 100 to Tk 20 lakh at different steps of the process to avail land related services, which highlight the unacceptable extent to which governance and accountability mechanisms are absent in this important sector.

SC scraps Hazari�s acquittal in graft case
The Supreme Court today scrapped a High Court verdict that had acquitted Joynal Abedin Hazari, former Awami League lawmaker from Feni, in a corruption case.

A Special Judge's Court of Dhaka on November 27, 2008 sentenced Hazari to 10 years� imprisonment and fined him Tk one crore for amassing illegal wealth worth Tk 1.13 crore.

On December 5, 2011, the High Court acquitted him of the charge following an appeal filed by the accused challenging the lower court verdict.

Today, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court asked the High Court to rehear and dispose of the appeal.

The four-member bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha passed the order in response to an appeal filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission challenging the High Court verdict.

Egypt's government resigns amid corruption probe
Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb and his Cabinet resigned Saturday amid a corruption investigation that led to the arrest of the agriculture minister last week.

The Egyptian government has long been plagued by corruption allegations.

Mehleb walked out of a press conference in Tunisia earlier this week after being asked about the corruption allegations.

When the company deployed them at a garment factory in Gazipur, they spent a month to figure out the best time to strike.

The national ID cards the robbers had given their employer -- Institute of Safety, Security and Information Technology (ISSIT) -- proved to be false in Rab investigation, raising question about the recruitment process of such security service providers.

�The gang had looted another garment factory in Badda area using the same technique in 2015,� said Mufti.

According to Rab, Mahbub, Faruk, Rana were accused in a case filed following the Badda robbery.

Belayet was accused in a bank robbery case filed in Jhenidah and a jewellery shop robbery case filed in Chandpur.

Rubel is accused of murder in Barisal, Rab claimed.

Sub-inspector Mohiuddin Ratan of Kotwali Police Station filed one of the cases against five named and 400 to 450 unnamed persons.

The other case (no-46), filed by Shafiqul Islam Shwapan, supervisor of the swimming pool construction project, was filed against 59 named BCL leaders including its Chittagong city unit president Emran Ahammed Emu and general secretary Nurul Azim Rony.

Also, to avoid public sufferings, we wanted to hold a rally inside the stadium when police barred our entry and swooped on us.�

�We have also submitted a memorandum to the commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police in this regard,� he said.

He also said the Chittagong city unit of BCL yesterday postponed a rally they called protesting the police action.

Meanwhile, when asked about the future of the construction project, Chittagong City Corporation Mayor and city unit Awami League General Secretary AJM Nasir Uddin said, �I see no obstacle.

We have taken a decision to implement the project anyhow��

Nasir said this while talking to reporters after inaugurating CJKS Mayor Gold Cup Inter-Ward Football Tournament at MA Aziz Stadium yesterday.

Chile midfielder Vidal was shown a second yellow card by Kassai in the 84th minute for what was a clean challenge on Marco Asensio, tilting the game in Madrid's favour as they entered extra-time trailing 2-1.

There were other contentious decisions on the night, including Casemiro avoiding a red card for a late foul on Bayern's Arjen Robben when already booked and an offside against Robert Lewandowski in the second half when the Polish striker was well placed.

"Arturo's card was not a card and then two goals for Cristiano were offside," said the Italian.

According to reports in Spain, police were forced to remove three Bayern Munich players from the referee's dressing room following their tempestuous exit.

TV station El Chiringuito claims that the incensed Chilean, Robert Lewandowski and Thiago Alcantara marched into referee Victor Kassai's dressing room after the match to confront him.

The trio are said to have launched stinging insults at the Hungarian official and laid the blame for the result squarely at his feet.

The trio refused to leave and only eventually exited the room once the Spanish police came in, reports claim.

�Bangladeshi� shot dead in Los Angeles robbery
A Bangladeshi youth was shot dead during a robbery at a gas station in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

The deceased was identified as Mizanur Rahman, 30, of Shibganj upazila in Chapainawabganj.

He was a MBA student and working as an attendant at Chevron Gas Station there, reports our Rajshahi correspondent.

A man entered the gas station at the intersection of Vermont St and Los Feliz and purchased an item around 3:30am, said LAPD Detective Meghan Aguilar, reports Los Angeles Times.

Retired school teacher Abdur Rafiq, the victim�s father, said Mizanur�s dream was to get a US degree, expected to return home in December this year.

After completing his BBA at the East West University in Dhaka, he went to the US to do his MBA with scholarship in 2014.

Co-workers said Mizanur worked overnight shift to earn money for his family and put himself through graduate school, LA Times reported.

Turning her head as if to get a glimpse of the Myanmar coastline she left behind 10 days ago, Afia heaved a sigh of relief: the miseries back home wouldn't touch her anymore.

Just a few days and she would get married in Malaysia!

But the situation on the other side -- at a jungle camp in Sadao district of bordering Thai province of Songkhla where her fianc� went to receive her -- was beyond her imagination.

As soon as he reached there from Malaysia, guards of the camp confined him to a cage at gunpoint.

The guard forced her to live with him there for seven months before disappearing all on a sudden, she told Chris Lewa, coordinator of The Arakan Project, an advocacy group which has been monitoring Rohingya refugee situation and maritime movements in Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia since 1999.

Describing Afia's ordeal to The Daily Star, Lewa said one of the smuggled families, who were on the same trafficking vessel as Aifa and had paid ransom for freedom, took Afia to Malaysia with them later on.

�When I met her at a camp in Malaysia last year, she was still looking for her would-be-groom,� Lewa told The Daily Star.

WOMEN MADE SEX SLAVES

Many Rohingyas who moved to Malaysia to flee persecution at home bring their daughters and sisters there for marriage, while many others pay the traffickers a hefty amount for bringing their would-be-wives by the sea.

"Every night, two to three young and pretty Rohingya women were taken out from the detention pens by the guards to a clandestine place," Nur Khaidha Abdul Shukur, a Rakhine victim from Maungdaw who passed through a trafficking camp in Thai border town of Padang Besar last year and is now staying in Alor Setar, Malaysia, told the Bernama news agency.

Two young women, who had been held at the transit camp for more than six months, became pregnant after gangrape, said Khaidha, who entered Malaysia illegally late last year after paying the smugglers a big amount for her release from the Thai camp.

Her husband Nurul Amin Nobi, who managed to escape from a trafficking camp after 22 days at Wang Kelian in Malaysia last year, also spoke of similar crimes being committed at nearby camps on Malaysian side of the border.

During a visit to the southern border of Thailand last month, this correspondent met Thai security officials who admitted to having heard of similar experiences from the victims.

Chris Lewa, however, said she did not meet any such Bangladeshi victims.

�The women being smuggled by the sea are mostly from Myanmar, most of them are Rohingyas.

Many of them board the trawlers with their children.�

ABUSE ON VESSELS TOO

Two Bangladeshi trafficking victims, whom the police arrested at a jungle camp in Padang Besar, told The Daily Star that women were raped every night during their voyage in December, 2013.

The women victims, all of whom were from Rakhine and other parts of Myanmar, were kept at one corner of their modified fishing trawler.

�During the night, the brokers used to go there and [sexually] abuse them,� said Nur Alam, an 18-year-old boy from Shariatpur who was duped to a boat by one of his neighbours with a false promise to take him to Malaysia.

�All of us understood what was happening but could not protest due to torture and fear of being thrown into the sea,� said Shahabuddin, another Bangladeshi survivor from the boat.

The Malaysian government on May 25 also announced to have discovered 139 similar graves in a series of 28 camps on the Malaysian side of the border.

These women travel to Malaysia to join would-be husbands or brothers and fathers who have fled persecution in Myanmar.

The story of two such women who had been held at a transit camp in Malaysia for more than six months, becoming pregnant as a result of gang rape by the traffickers, shows how easily these criminals have been carrying out their diabolical activities in these slave camps.

The international community, especially Myanmar, from where these victims are fleeing, and Malaysia, the destination point, must come forward to find ways to rescue these helpless women and catch these criminals who are guilty of kidnapping, torture, killing and now rape.

Again, all this just points to the reality that Myanmar must put a stop to the persecution of Rohingya Muslims and give them the citizenship they rightfully deserve.

Outrageous gang-rape again
Amid countrywide outrage and concern over sexual abuse against women, a girl has been gang-raped on a boat by four people in Gazipur�s Kaliganj upazila.

The 18-year-old girl is said to be a worker of Pran-RFL Group in Narsingdi.

She was violated by four youths who also works for the same company, our Gazipur correspondent reports quoting locals and police.

On Wednesday, the girl was returning to her home to Nargana in the upazila around 8:00pm when she boarded a boat, owned by the company, on the Sitalakhya river, said Arif Hossen, an assistant sub-inspector of Kaliganj police.

Two others have managed to flee.�

Mostafizur Rahman, officer-in-charge (OC), of Kaliganj Police Station, today said that a case has been filed in this connection.

Only a few days ago, the country was outraged by the gang-rape of a woman, belonging to the Garo ethnic community, in a microbus in capital Dhaka.

Prior to this, sexual abuse on women during Pahela Baishakh at Dhaka University and Jahangirnagar University drew widespread outrage and triggered protests everywhere.

Hundreds raped by Boko Haram militants


Now, dozens of newly freed women and girls, many of them pregnant and battered, are showing up at a sprawling camp for the displaced here outside the Borno State capital, Maiduguri, as Nigerian soldiers and other military forces try to push Boko Haram out of nearby territory it has occupied for much of the past year.

Six years ago, Nigerian security forces clashed violently with Boko Haram members, and the group has been waging unremitting war against the federal government ever since.

It recently declared allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and its successes over the years contributed substantially to the defeat of the incumbent president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, in a March election.

Thousands have been killed in Boko Haram�s war against the Nigerian state, often characterized by the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians.

People from several towns said the militants had not been defeated, as the Nigerian military maintains, but had simply fled as troops advanced with superior firepower.

Nigerian officials have reacted gingerly as the evidence of large-scale sexual violence by Boko Haram emerges.

- Asks explanation why Garo victim�s complaint was initially not accepted

- Govt show-caused on why not compensate the indigenous victim



Citing those reports, the High Court today ordered the government to put out a circular directing all police stations to record any rape complaint.

A compliance report was also sought from home secretary, inspector general of police and Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner by a month.

The judges also asked the government to show-cause why the High Court will not pass out an order to compensate the victim.

The writ was moved by rights groups Nari Pakkha, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, Jatiya Adivasi Parishad, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) and Ain O Shalish Kendra � yesterday.



�After I heard this incident, every time I passed Jashimuddin road I felt insecure, and scared,� said Prima Chakma, a young university graduate living in Dhaka city.



The High Court has further asked the petitioners to suggest names to form an experts committee to review the law for prevention of sexual harassment and violence.

We applaud the rights organisations and the High Court for putting pressure on the government to make sure law enforcers are prompt and sensitive when dealing with cases which the victims file under tremendous physical and mental trauma.

This is how these beasts lured her into the microbus, gaining her trust first and then offering to drop her off at her home in Uttara, before they brutally tortured her.

DB Police impersonators on the rise
The number of incidents of abduction carried out by criminals posing as DB Police, have apparently gone up in the capital prompting the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) to ask the public to help catch the imposters.

In the event of individuals trying to arrest people by claiming to be DB Police, the DMP has urged citizens to demand ID cards and check if they are wearing the specific vests that such officials are required to wear during operations.

It is unlikely that ordinary citizens, who harbour a general wariness for law enforcers of any brand, will have the temerity to ask for ID or even know how to make sure the vests are authentic.

Two Bangladeshis, not one, abducted by IS in Libya
Two Bangladeshi nationals, not one as learnt earlier, have been identified to be among the nine people abducted from an oilfield in Libya on Friday, the Bangladesh embassy has confirmed.

Initially Anowar Hossain was mistakenly identified as a Sudanese national having the same name.

is AE3630754, hails from Noakhali district, according to a foreign ministry press release.

Yesterday, the foreign ministry informed that Helal Uddin, bearing passport No-B0156553 hailing from Jamalpur was the only Bangladeshi among nine others held hostage by the terrorist group ISIS.

However, Anowar�s identification was confirmed by a Bangladeshi working in a neighboring oil field.

Bangladesh Embassy in Tripoli is maintaining constant vigil on the matter.

Libyan Foreign Ministry informed the Bangladesh Mission that they were trying heart and soul to rescue the victims.

No group has claimed kidnapping 2 Bangladeshis yet: Minister
None of the infighting groups in Lybia has yet claimed the responsibilities of taking hostage two Bangladeshis in Libya, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam said today.

The two Bangladeshis have been identified as Helal Uddin of Jamalpur and Anowar Hossain from Noakhali.

On Monday, a foreign ministry release said those kidnapped by ISIS militants from al-Ghani oilfield included one Bangladeshi national -- Helal Uddin of Jamalpur, bearing passport No B0156553.

The ministry issued another statement yesterday saying, �The Bangladesh embassy in Tripoli has confirmed that apart from Mr Helal Uddin, another Bangladeshi has been identified��

�It has been informed that initially Mr Anowar was mistakenly identified as Sudanese national having similar name.

However, Mr Anowar's identity was confirmed by a Bangladeshi working in a neighbouring oilfield.�

According to the international media, the kidnapped foreigners were working for the Austrian oil services company VAOS and they included four Filipinos, a Ghanaian, an Austrian and a Czech.

With Libya plunging into chaos amid turf war between two rival governments and the rise of Islamist extremists, Bangladesh halted sending workers to the country in May last year.

An illegal market of children has developed in China, in which babies are being openly sold online.

It was a few days before the Chinese New Year in February 2007 and Xiao Chaohua was working at his small clothes shop in an industrial zone of Huizhou, a city in China's Pearl River delta, not far from Hong Kong.

For the first year, he rode his motorbike across Guangdong province - China's manufacturing heartlands.

And then Xiao began an extraordinary journey across China.

Thousands of Chinese parents experience Xiao's agony every year.

The Chinese government provides no figures, but the US State Department has estimated that 20,000 children are abducted annually, or 400 a week.

Chinese state media have suggested the true figure could even be 200,000 per year, though the police reject this higher estimate.

There is a traditional preference for boys in Chinese culture as they carry on the family name and provide financial support for elderly parents.

Child trafficking first received wide publicity in China 12 years ago, when police in Guangxi province discovered 28 babies in the back of a bus.

While Chinese courts already deal firmly with traffickers, Xiao wants tougher penalties for people who buy children.

DB Police impersonators on the rise
The number of incidents of abduction carried out by criminals posing as DB Police, have apparently gone up in the capital prompting the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) to ask the public to help catch the imposters.

In the event of individuals trying to arrest people by claiming to be DB Police, the DMP has urged citizens to demand ID cards and check if they are wearing the specific vests that such officials are required to wear during operations.

It is unlikely that ordinary citizens, who harbour a general wariness for law enforcers of any brand, will have the temerity to ask for ID or even know how to make sure the vests are authentic.

Members of Crime Scene Unit of CID brought the DNA and other samples of teeth, nails and body to Dhaka for examination.

New call in Poland to extradite Roman Polanski to US
Poland's justice minister says he will appeal against a decision not to extradite film director Roman Polanski to the US for statutory rape.

Zbigniew Ziobro, who is also Poland's prosecutor general, said he would make the appeal in the Supreme Court.

Polanski has French and Polish citizenship.

France does not extradite its own citizens but the director occasionally visits Poland, attending a press event in Katowice just last week.

Swiss authorities turned down a US extradition warrant in 2010, after placing Polanski under house arrest for nine months.

Dutch woman arrested in Qatar after making rape claim
A Dutch woman is being detained in Qatar on suspicion of adultery after she told police she had been raped.

A Dutch foreign ministry spokeswoman said the woman, who she named as Laura, had been arrested but not yet been charged.

For the sake of the defendant's case we will not make further comments at this point," the Dutch embassy said in a statement.

'Great horror'

The woman had gone dancing at a hotel in Doha where alcohol was allowed, "but when she returned to the table after the first sip of her drink... she felt very unwell" and realised she had been drugged, her lawyer Brian Lokollo told Dutch broadcaster NOS-Radio1.

It is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in public in Qatar, although alcohol is allowed at certain hotels and expatriates can obtain a permit for purchasing alcohol.

In 2013, a Norwegian woman in neighbouring United Arab Emirates was given a 16-month prison sentence for perjury, extramarital sex and drinking alcohol after she told police she had been raped.

She was later pardoned and allowed to return to Norway.

�We found evidence of sexual intercourse before her death,� Kamoda Prosad Saha, head of the three-member board that conducted the second autopsy at Comilla Medical College, said yesterday.

�The doctor who conducted the first autopsy at Comilla Medical College didn't find any evidence of rape and mention the specific reason for Tonu's death in the report,� said Kamoda on April 4.

My daughter was brutally murdered and later dumped in the bush,� Anwara Begum, mother of the victim, told The Daily Star over the phone.

�The second autopsy report is a duplicate copy of the first one and the doctors prepared it just changing some words.�

Anwara, who saw a ray of hope after the DNA test results came out, is now very much disappointed with the findings.

Tonu, a Victoria College student and theatre activist, was found murdered in a bush inside Comilla Cantonment area on March 20.

The first autopsy was conducted by Dr Sharmin Sultana of Comilla Medical College on March 21.

Qatar convicts Dutch woman held 'after being raped'
A court in Qatar has convicted a Dutch woman of having sex outside marriage after she told police she was raped.

'Horror'

The Dutch ambassador to Qatar, Yvette Burghgraef-van Eechoud, said after Monday's court hearing that she expected the woman to leave Qatar within days.

The woman was arrested by Qatari police immediately after reporting that she had been raped on the night of 15 March, as was the alleged assailant.

Doha-based lawyer Najeeb al-Nuaimi, Qatar's former justice minister, told the Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera the woman's lawyers would have had to prove there had been "no voluntary actions" between her and the man for him to be charged with rape.

Article 281 of Qatar's penal code states: "Whoever copulates with a female over 16 without compulsion, duress or ruse shall be punished with imprisonment for a term up to seven years.

The case of the Dutch woman raises further questions about how the Qatari authorities will deal with the thousands of Western tourists expected to travel to the country for the 2022 Fifa World Cup, many of whom may be unfamiliar with its laws.

Currently, Cosby has not been charged with any crime and has denied the accusations of rape and sexual assault by dozens of women.

In a deposition from 2005-06, released recently by the New York Times, Cosby does acknowledge he gave women the strong sedative, Quaalude, "the same as a person would say have a drink" but claims all sexual relations were consensual.These women tell a very different story.The women, from 10 different states and diverse walks of life, share detailed accounts of Cosby using his power to entice them into his home, a hotel room or to dine with him and then offering them drugs and taking advantage of them sexually.

"The women have found solace in their number -- discovering that they hadn�t been alone, that there were others out there who believed them implicitly, with whom they didn�t need to be afraid of sharing the darkest details of their lives," NY Mag reads.

The way it tried to defend these two criminals is surprising, given AI�s long track record, which is not always stone-paved (its false claim of babies being killed by Saddam Hussein in Iraq is just a reminder).

After these were done, the US Ambassador-at-large for War Crimes, Stephen Rapp, who closely observed the trial process, had concluded by saying �the best way in the world to find the truth is the judicial process where the evidence is presented, where witnesses are cross-examined, where both sides have an opportunity to be heard and that is what is being done here (Bangladesh).

It is the process that the American government strongly supports.�

AI statement�s third paragraph is also motivated and travesty of truth.

And he said: �Al-Badr is the Azrail (angel of death) to the Indian agents.�

During the trial, a witness said he saw Mojaheed in a torture cell where hundreds of freedom fighters were killed.

He also heard the war criminal say to a Pakistani army officer about a few freedom fighters who should be shot dead.

In the European front, the bombing of Dresden was a debatable issue as British and American aircraft dropped 3,900 pounds of bombs on the cultural city.

Allegations are, Parimal sexually assaulted one of his students twice in his Badda coaching centre in Dhaka in 2011.

�Bangladesh reviewing ties with Pakistan�
Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali today said the government is assessing the relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan and thinking about what measures need to be taken over the reaction of Islamabad after the execution of two war criminals last month.

�The whole matter is a continuous process,� he said while addressing a discussion at WVA auditorium in Dhaka.

Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee organised the discussion on �Relationship between Bangladesh-India in the Touchstone of Time� to mark the 44th anniversary of the recognition of India to Bangladesh as an independent country.

Hours after Bhutan�s recognition, India recognised an independent Bangladesh on December 6 in 1971.

It�s ridiculous.�

Earlier on November 22, Pakistan's foreign ministry made a statement, voicing �deep concern and anguish� over the capital punishments of Jamaat leader Mojaheed and BNP leader Salauddin.

It prompted Bangladesh to summon the Pakistan envoy in Dhaka for lodging a formal protest.

In an apparent response to Bangladesh's move, Pakistan Earlier on November 30 summoned acting high commissioner of Bangladesh Maushumi Rahman to its foreign ministry and denied committing any war crimes or atrocities during the 1971 Liberation War.

Pakistan also rejected Bangladesh's statement that trashed Islamabad's concern over the recent executions of war criminals Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and Salauddin Quader Chowdhury.

Bangladesh handed over the protest note to the Pakistan high commissioner in Dhaka after summoning him to the foreign ministry on November 23, a day after Pakistan issued a statement over the executions.

Pakistan's latest move triggered outrage in Bangladesh as war crimes trial campaigners accused the country of �resorting to falsehood� over its role in 1971.

ON BANGLADESH-INDIA RELATION

Talking about the country�s relationship with India, Ali said the relationship between Bangladesh and India is now in a very good state after 1975.

�The problems lie between Bangladesh and India is psychological which needs to be resolved with the participation of everyone.�

While pointing out different indicators of good relationship between the countries, he said the Bangladesh Visa Office in Agartala has been upgraded to Assistant High Commission and an Assistant High Commissioner took over the charges today.

Eminent historian Prof Muntassir Mamoon said the relationship between Bangladesh and India was stronger until 1975 and deteriorated between 1975 and 1995.

?

The worldwide condemnations against such genocide and the historic evidences which remain tell us that Pakistan is lying about its heinous act.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan on November 30 summoned the acting Bangladesh High-Commissioner in Pakistan and denied the allegation of genocide saying, �Pakistan also rejected insinuation of complicity in committing crimes or war atrocities.

Nothing could be further from the truth.�

Associated Press photographer Burhan Ozbilici was covering a photo exhibition in Ankara when a gunman opened fire, assassinating Russia�s ambassador to Turkey.

Turkish authorities have imposed a temporary blackout on coverage of the shooting of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.

�The event seemed routine, the opening of an exhibit of photographs of Russia.

Instead, it was a coolly calculated assassination, unfolding in front of me and others who scrambled, terrified, for cover as the trim man with short hair gunned down the Russian ambassador,� said Burhan Ozbilici.

After Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov began to make his address, I moved closer to photograph him, thinking the pictures would come in useful for stories on Turkish-Russian relations.

�He was speaking softly and � from what I could tell � lovingly about his homeland, stopping occasionally to allow the translator to relay his words in Turkish.

But people later said he was shouting about the Syrian city of Aleppo.

�So he was probably angry about Russian bombardments of Aleppo that were aimed at driving out anti-government rebels.

Muslim with links to govt murdered in Rakhine: Myanmar
A man has been found dead with stab wounds in Myanmar�s Rakhine State, in what the government said on Monday was the second murder in under a week of a Rohingya who cooperated with authorities as they crack down on suspected insurgents.

The government of predominantly Buddhist Myanmar blamed Muslim Rohingyas supported by foreign militants.

State media has reported at least 86 deaths and the United Nations says 34,000 people have fled to Bangladesh.

The violence poses a challenge to Aung San Suu Kyi�s government and has renewed international criticism that the Nobel laureate has done too little to help the Rohingya, who are denied citizenship in Myanmar.

Residents and rights groups say soldiers have raped Rohingya women, burnt homes and killed civilians during the operation near the frontier with Bangladesh.

Protests on, no clue found
Protesters block roads with logs and burning spent tyres at different places at Sundarganj in Gaibandha on Sunday in protest at the killing ruling Awami League lawmaker Md Manzurul Islam Liton on Saturday.

Gunmen on Saturday evening killed the lawmaker at his village home at Sundarganj in Gaibandha.

The murder sparked protests in the northern region of the country and three platoons of paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh were deployed at Sundarganj.

Gaibandha police additional superintendent Md Rabiul Islam said that they until Sunday evening picked up 18 people for interrogation.

His widow Khurshid Jahan Smirity, who took Liton to Rangpur Medical College Hospital, where he died, told New Age the attackers carried out the attack very quickly.

On Sunday morning, a three-member team, led by Rangpur Medical College�s forensic department head Narayan Chandra Saha, conducted the post-mortem examination of the body.

Sundarganj police station inspector (investigation) Abu Haydar Md Ashrafuzzaman could not say which types of firearms were used in the attack.

AL general secretary Obaidul Quader at a press conference in Dhaka on Sunday said �religious extremist forces� might be behind the killing.

In Rangpur, Awami League organising secretary Jahangir Kabir Nanok, however, singled out �Jamaat-Shibir-extremists� for the attack and termed it a �planned murder�.

Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir in statement expressed deep concerns over the killing and criticised the law and order situation.

Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami in a statement on Sunday condemned the arrest of more than 50 leaders and activists of the party in Gaibandha, Nilphamari, Rangpur and Joypurhat following the killing.

The first funeral prayer of the slain lawmaker was held on Rangpur Police Lines School and College ground on Sunday.

His body was flown to Dhaka by a helicopter and was kept at a mortuary.

The lawmaker grabbed the headlines after shooting eight-year-old schoolboy Shahadat Hossain Sourav at Sundarganj on October 2, 2015 allegedly under the influence of alcohol, drawing huge nationwide criticism.

Liton was elected lawmaker from Gaibandha-1 (Sundarganj) parliamentary constituency in the 2014 general elections, which was boycotted by all opposition parties.

There are, of course, little reasons for surprise at the situation if the way the incumbents have given free hand to the police, especially after the controversial January 5, 2014 polls that helped the government to retain power, to tackle movement organised by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies, in particular, is taken into account.

Myanmar: a scribe�s murder and its aftermath
The year 2016 ends with the statistics of 16 journalist-murder incidents in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh along with Myanmar, writes Nava Thakuria

KILLING of media persons in the Indian subcontinent is no unusual happening as it annually loses around 10 journalists to assailants.

India, Pakistan and Afghanistan often lead the list of victims with additional inputs from Bangladesh and Myanmar, where Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Tibet (under China) and Nepal normally maintain their no-jounalist killing index.

Myanmar (also known as Burma or Brahmadesh) as a whole witness lesser incidents of journalist-killing and the Buddhist majority country witnessed the assassination of only five journalists in the past one and a half decades.

Ko Soe Moe Tun, 35, a Monywa (Sagaing)-based Burmese journalist was found dead on December 13, 2016, who was convincingly targeted for his extensive investigation and coverage on the wood smuggling, illegal logging and mining in north-west Myanmar.

Myanmar, which still possesses some of the most important biodiversity areas in the world, faces massive deforestations because of its prized teak wood and other wildlife.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, Myanmar lost one-fourth of its forest covers in the last two and half decades.

Myanmar Journalist Network, while condoling on the demise of Soe, seconded the family�s view arguing that the young scribe used to write regularly on conservation issues and often received threats from the illegal logging traders before his death.

Myanmar Press Council also supported the view arguing that threats against the journalists are common in the country.

The overall media freedom in Myanmar has improved since 2011, the year Myanmar�s military rulers handed over the political power to a quasi-civilian government led by president Thein Sein.

Though the great lady could not become the President, because of some clauses in the 2008 military backed constitution, Suu Kyi emerges as the most powerful political figure in Myanmar.

Sadly, the Burmese journalist fraternity continues to work under threats, earlier if it was from the military forces, now it comes from different anti-social elements.

The Yangon-based Myanmar Frontier, in one of its editorials, argued that there were many challenges for the newly emerged democratic government, �but ensuring a media that is free from threats and is able to carry out its work would be a sign that the country (Myanmar) is moving in the right direction�.

The year 2016 ends with the statistics of 16 journalist-murder incidents in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh along with Myanmar.

India witnessed the murder of six journalists (Tarun Mishra from Uttar Pradesh, Indradev Yadav/Akhilesh Pratap Singh from Jharkhand, Rajdeo Ranjan from Bihar, Anshita Bawa from Punjab, Kishore Dave from Gujarat and Dharmendra Kumar Singh from Bihar) in 12 months.

India�s troubled neighbour Pakistan lost three journalists (Mehmood Khan, Shehzad Ahmed and Muhammad Umar) to assailants, but Afghanistan lost more scribes (Nematullah Zahir, David Gilkey, Zabihullah Tamanna, Yaqoub Sharafat and Mohammad Zubair Khaksar) in 2016.

Myanmar and India�s immediate neighbor Bangladesh reported the killing of one editor (Xulhaz Mannan) and a netizen (Samad Nazijmuddin) in the bygone year.

Prior to Soe�s murder, Myanmar had lost four journalists namely Aung Kyaw Naing (also known as Ko Par Gyi in 2014), Kenji Nagai (2007), Hla Han and Tha Win (1999) to assailants with impunity.

Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Sans Frontiers, Myanmar Journalists Association, International Federation of Journalists, etc, deplored the murder of Soe and demanded actions against the criminals.

Facing the heat, the Myanmar authorities recently detained three suspects in the murder, but reportedly two of them were already released.

The Asia-Pacific Forum of Environmental Journalists, while appreciating the Myanmar police for questioning few persons relating to Soe�s murder, has urged the authority for further investigation and stringent actions against the culprits.

He also appealed to the Burmese government to adequately compensate the family of the slain journalist and support his eight years old son in pursuing proper education.

Sohagi Jahan Tonu, 19, a second-year history student of Comilla Victoria College and a member of Victoria College Theatre, was found dead at Comilla Mainamati Cantonment on March 20, 2016 after she went out of her residence for private tuition.

Tonu�s father Yaar Hossain filed a murder case against some unidentified people with the Kotwali model police.

Tonu�s mother Anwara Begum said, �I�ve no hope to see the judgment in my lifetime but I want justice even after my demise.�

Comilla senior superintendent of police (CID) Jalal Uddin and also the investigation officer of the case, said, �The investigation is going on in its own way.�

He, however, refused to make any comment over the case.

7-murder didn�t taint RAB image: Benazir
Noting that some RAB members individually got involved in the sensational seven-murder incident of Narayanganj, its director general Benazir Ahmed on Friday claimed that it did not tarnish the force�s image as a whole.

He made the remarks while speaking at a programme marking the distribution of blankets among the poor at Rangpur Water Development Board ground at noon.

A Narayanganj court on January 16 convicted 35 people, including 25 former RAB officials, of abducting and killing seven people, including Narayanganj panel mayor Nazrul Islam and senior lawyer Chandan Kumar and sentenced 26 of them to death and the rest to different terms of imprisonment.

The RAB chief also said his force is working with police to debunk the mystery behind the

killing of Gaibandha MP Manjurul Islam Liton.

Mentioning that most of the militants hail from northern region, he said RAB in association with Dhaka University has taken an initiative to conduct a research on why they get involved in militancy.

Meanwhile, South Asia Director of Human Rights Watch Meenakshi Ganguly urged Bangladesh government to disband RAB and replace the force with a rights-respecting force.

In her recent article posted on official website of the HRW titled �After Narayanganj verdict, Bangladesh should

disband RAB� Meenakshi mentioned that while in opposition the Awami League called for the disbanding of RAB.

No more delay in cracking Tonu murder case
IT HAS already been 10 months since the murder of the 19-year-old college girl took place inside the Comilla cantonment but investigations are yet to find the motive of the murder or detect the perpetrators.

There are reasons to believe that all the assurances might have been given only to assuage the growing protests, as seen in many other cases such as the murder of the journalist couple in February 2012 inside their flat in Dhaka which still remains unsolved.

However, there are reasons to believe that it will hardly understand the reality on its own as its apparent unwillingness to bring the perpetrators of the much-talked-about Twaki murder in Narayanganj to trial has so far denied the victim�s family justice even after the culprits, allegedly tied to the local ruling party unit, being identified.

HC receives seven-murder verdict copy
The High Court on Sunday received the Narayanganj seven murder case�s 165 page verdict and other documents from the Narayanganj District and Sessions Judge�s Court.

On January 16, former leader of ruling Awami League�s Narayanganj unit, Noor Hossain, 16 former Rapid Action Battalion members and nine others were sentenced to death for abduction and murder of seven people and dumping their bodies into Sitalakhya river in lieu of money in April 2014.

The seven murder case was numbered as death reference 3 of 2017, said the superintendent of Death Reference�s Section at the High Court Division.

High Court Division�s additional registrar Sabbir Faiz said that hearing in the death reference for the confirmation of the death sentences would take a long time if the normal procedures are followed as about 500 death references were now pending with the High Court.

He, however, said that the Narayanganj death reference might be given priority over other death references if the chief justice allowed considering the public importance of the sensational case.

He said that if the chief justice gave priority to the Narayanganj death reference over the others, the High Court would need to prepare the paper book, a compilation of all documents including the verdict of the case, for the hearing in the death reference.

Myanmar mass murder made in America
THE Southeast Asian state of Myanmar has recently become the epicentre of an expanding humanitarian crisis.

But because the current government of Myanmar is headed by a regime favoured by American and European interests, little attention and even less action has been given to the conflict.

A January 10, 2017 Guardian article titled, �65,000 Rohingya flee from Myanmar to Bangladesh following crackdown: UN�, reports that:

At least 65,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar � a third of them over the past week � since the army launched a crackdown in the north of Rakhine state.

The same article claims:

The stories have cast a pall over the young government of Aung San Suu Kyi, with mainly Muslim Malaysia being especially critical.

The fact that Suu Kyi�s political party came to power on a decades-long tsunami of US and European cash and political support, despite US-European knowledge of Suu Kyi�s supporters harbouring racist, even genocidal intentions toward the Rohingya, makes the West at the very least partially responsible for the current crisis.

Occasional articles like the UK Independent�s 2012 report titled, �Burma�s monks call for Muslim community to be shunned�, reveal both Myanmar�s �hardline Buddhists� and even activist groups celebrated in the West for �promoting democracy� are involved in persecuting the Rohingya.

The Independent would also admit that:

Ko Ko Gyi, a democracy activist with the 88 Generation Students group and a former political prisoner, said: �The Rohingya are not a Burmese ethnic group.

Myanmar�s minister of information was trained by America

NOT only has the US and UK substantially funded and backed Suu Kyi�s political party, but ministers within her government have been trained by US-funded programmes, including Myanmar�s current minister of information Pe Myint.

The Myanmar Times article, �Who�s who: Myanmar�s new cabinet�, would provide Pe Myint�s background, reporting (our emphasis):

Formerly a doctor with a degree from the Institute of Medicine, U Pe Myint changed careers after 11 years and received training as a journalist at the Indochina Media Memorial Foundation in Bangkok.

He participated in the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa in 1998, and was also editor-in-chief of The People�s Age Journal.

The Indochina Media Memorial Foundation in Bangkok is run by the Foreign Correspondents� Club of Thailand, a collection of US and European media representatives.

And according to a Wikileaks document titled, �An Overview of Northern Thailand-Based Burmese Media Orgranisations�, the IMMF�s funding is revealed (our emphasis):

Other organisations, some with a scope beyond Burma, also add to the educational opportunities for Burmese journalists.

The Chiang Mai-based Indochina Media Memorial Foundation, for instance, last year completed training courses for Southeast Asian reporters that included Burmese participants.

The NED (National Endowment for Democracy) is both funded and directed by the US Congress and the US State Department.

In essence, Myanmar�s current Minister of Information and the lies his ministry tells on a daily basis, particularly in regards to his government�s brutality toward the Rohingya, has been made possible in part by US government funding and support.

While human rights abuses real or imagined have been used to justify entire wars waged by Western military forces elsewhere, very real abuses in Myanmar are being carefully spun to protect the very government and its support base responsible for carrying them out.

Many times, as is the case in Myanmar, such opportunism and self-interest find themselves trampling such principles entirely.

No charge sheet in Taqi murder yet
The Rapid Action Battalion is yet to submit its investigation report into the abduction and murder of A-level student Tanwir Muhammad Taqi in Narayanganj in March 2013 even after three years of its announcement about the completion of the investigation.

Taqi�s father Rafiur Rabbi, a leading cultural activist in Narayanganj, question the delay in the submission of the charge sheet as the investigation and collection of evidences were completed by November 2013 and the battalion had announced in March 2014 that they would submit the charge sheet in weeks.

Rafiur filed the case with Narayanganj police station on March 8, 2013 against unnamed people.

The case was transferred to the battalion for investigation following a High Court order.

In June, 2013, the battalion arrested some suspects and raided office of Ajmeri Osman, son of Shamim�s brother Jatiya Party lawmaker Nasim Osman, in Narayanganj city in August 2013, and found evidence of torture there.

According to them, the two had stated that Taqi was abducted from near Srama Kallyan Office in Narayanganj city and tortured to death at Winner Fashion house.

Yusuf reportedly left the country after obtaining bail from the high Court while Sultan was released on October 25, 2015 on a High Court bail.

The battalion in March 2014 also cited Rabbi�s support to Narayanganj city mayor Selina Hayat Ivy was the motive behind the murder.

Narayanganj civic committee secretary Abdur Rahman demanded justice for the killing of Taqi.

The said the investigation into Taqi murder and the trial should be expedite like the seven-murder case, in which 26 people, including former local Awami League leader Noor Hossain and 16 former members of Rapid Action Battalion were sentenced to death on January 16, 2017 on charge of abductions and murders of seven people in Narayanganj in April 2014

On a tip-off, a joint team of Salikha and Magura police stations conducted a drive at Bhayna intersection in the town around 11:00am and arrested Enamul, said Md Tariqul Islam Tarique, additional superintendent of police in Magura.

Twenty-six people, including former local Awami League leader Noor Hossain and 16 former members of Rapid Action Battalion were sentenced to death on January 16 on charge of abductions and murders of seven people in Narayanganj in 2014.

Taqi murderers still at large in Narayanganj
THE legal proceedings in the murder of Tanwir Muhammad Taqi have been stalled for nearly three years.

Taqi, of Chashara in Narayanganj, was abducted on March 6, 2013.

As the brutal details of Taqi�s torture began to come out, hundreds of protesters in Narayanganj and Dhaka erupted in anger demanding exemplary punishment of the killers of Taqi.

The verdict of the infamous seven-murder in Narayanganj and the conviction of 26 people, including ranking officials of the Rapid Action Battalion, sparked hope in a city long deprived of justice, but it had not breathed a sigh of relief since the murderers of Taqi, Chanchal and others are still at large.

Rabbi, when filing the case with the local police, stated that it is because of his role in the Narayanganj City Corporation election that time, and other recent civic movements, including the reduction of bus fare and resumption of state-run bus service on Narayanganj routes that he has been long targeted by local Awami League-backed business groups.

It is in this situation the claims of the current government after the verdict of the seven-murders of Narayanganj that it will spare no one involved in criminal activities appears rhetorical and untrue.

BSF finds 80-feet tunnel along Bangladesh border
An 80-feet long tunnel dug between India and Bangladesh has been found by Indian Border Security Force (BSF), reports NDTV.

BSF troops found the tunnel in north Bengal during searches along the 4,096 km border shared with Bangladesh.

Over the last 20 years, the BSF has discovered more than half-a-dozen instances of terrorists or drug traffickers digging a tunnel along the border with Pakistan.

This one, meant to make infiltration from Pakistan less of a risk, was 20-feet long.

The tunnel, located in Chopra region of West Bengal's North Dinajpur district, is the second instance of the BSF detecting a trans-border tunnel on the Bangladesh border.

In early March, the guards had detected a tunnel at the depth of 20-25 feet in Meghalaya; it was about 200 metres from the border fence, according to the Indian online news portal.

A week later, in mid-March, BSF personnel in Tripura detected smugglers trying to smuggle cattle from India to Bangladesh through an unfenced gap.

Sylhet Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Zaynal Abedin said that the supplementary charge sheet was sent to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate�s Court Sunday afternoon.

Sylhet metropolitan magistrate�s court on October 18, 2016 ordered the further investigation into the case rejecting the previous charge sheet filed on October 9, 2016 pressing charges against five extremism suspects and dropping 10 youths, including photojournalist Idris Ali.

A banker, Ananta was an activist of Muktamona Blogs and an organiser of Sylhet unit Ganajagaran Mancha.

Malaysia names North Korean diplomat wanted for questioning in airport murder
Malaysia�s Royal Police chief Khalid Abu Bakar (C) speaks during a news conference regarding the apparent assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of the North Korean leader, at the Malaysian police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, February 22, 2017.

� Reuters photo

Malaysian police named on Wednesday a senior official in the North Korean embassy and another linked to its state airline, wanted for questioning over the murder last week of Kim Jong Nam, the North Korean leader�s estranged half-brother.

Kim Jong Nam was killed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13 while he was preparing to board a flight to Macau, where he lived with his family under the protection of Beijing.

South Korean and US officials believe the killing was an assassination carried out by agents of the North to eliminate the elder half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Police chief Khalid Abu Bakar named the North Korean diplomat wanted for questioning as 44-year-old Hyon Kwang Song, and said he held the rank of second secretary at the embassy.

The police chief identified the Air Koryo staffer as Kim Uk Il, 37, and said another North Korean suspect wanted for questioning was Ri Ji U, but gave no further details.

He said all three were in Malaysia.

Calls on Wednesday to the North Korean embassy for comment on the latest developments went unanswered.

Malaysia has denied North Korea�s request for the body to be handed over to its embassy directly.

Malaysia has so far identified a total of eight North Koreans suspected of being linked to killing.

One is in custody, along with two women - one Vietnamese, one Indonesian - believed to have carried out the fatal assault using a fast-acting poison.

Khalid said police �strongly believed� four other North Koreans were back in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, having fled Malaysia on the day of the attack.

Diplomatic tensions have escalated between North Korea and Malaysia since the killing, with the countries tussling over custody of the victim�s body and trading barbs over Malaysia�s handling of the investigation.

North Korea Malaysia is one of the few countries in the world that maintains ties with the nuclear-armed nation.

Earlier this week Malaysia recalled its ambassador from Pyongyang, and prime minister Najib Razak rebuked the North Korea ambassador in Kuala Lumpur for making �diplomatically rude� comments.

Malaysia has said it will only release the body to the next-of-kin once the cause of death and identity have been confirmed.

British intel helped Bangladesh detect liquid cocaine smuggling
The recovery of huge quantity of liquid cocaine in Chittatong Port is a big success against international drug smuggling which has been possible due to the sharing of information between the intelligence agencies of Bangladesh and the UK.

The seizure of 185 kilograms of liquid cocaine is the second largest in recent times after the recovery of 310 kilograms of liquid cocaine by the Canadian customs three months back.

The cocaine came in a container from Bolivia.

In Bangladesh, expensive drugs like cocaine and that too in a liquid form is completely a new case for both the police and the customs intelligence.

The cocaine would have even been safely carried to its ultimate destination, probably in a European country, had it not been for the tips provided by the British intelligence.

It was the Special Branch (SB) of police who received a tip from the UK agency that a container of sunflower oil was to be shipped to Bangladesh from the South American region containing cocaine in liquid form.

Officials of the agency also informed that the cocaine was not sent for Bangladesh.

They said the international drug cartel would only use Bangladesh port as a transit point enroute to another country.

Those were the pieces of information the SB got from its counterpart in UK in the first week of May.

Sensing gravity of the matter, head of SB Javed Patwary himself got into the matter and went to Chittagong to search for the cocaine.

With the help of port authority and customs, SB officials first went through the records to know whether any company imported sunflower oil from the South American region in the last 3 months.

When all seemed grim, the SB boss got another tip from the UK agency about the importer company, Khan Jahan Ali Ltd.

Then one-day the owner disclosed that one of his employees, named Sohel, told him about sunflower oil from Bolivia.

He informed the SB and customs officials that Sohel�s relative who lives in UK sent the consignment and asked Sohel to release it.

The consignment, sent by a Bolivian company from Montevideo port in Uruguay, was unloaded on May 8.

It came to Bangladesh via Singapore.

Narcotics department�s test also failed to detect it and then samples were sent to BCSIR and Drug Testing Laboratory in Dhaka for further testing which tested positive for cocaine in one of the barrels on Saturday.

Bangladesh has no equipment or expertise to separate cocaine from oil and thus sought help of United Nations Office of the Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) in this regard.

It is clear to all that the sunflower oil consignment was brought to Bangladesh by an international drug cartel with a target to ship the liquid cocaine to a third country.

The bid to release the consignment by a Bangladeshi national in UK and some locals has already proved it.

They should be tracked down and arrested to dismantle the network in Bangladesh.

Malaysia says VX nerve agent was used in murder of Kim Jong Nam
The estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was killed with a highly toxic chemical weapon known as VX nerve agent, Malaysian police said on Friday, citing a preliminary report.

Kim Jong Nam died after being assaulted at Kuala Lumpur International Airport last Monday while preparing to board a flight to Macau.

South Korean and US officials have said they believe North Korean agents assassinated Kim Jong Nam, who had been living in the Chinese territory of Macau under Beijing's protection.

Police said swabs taken from the eye and the face of a North Korean national by the chemistry department of Malaysia revealed the presence of VX.

�Other exhibits are under analysis,� Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said in the statement.

Police chief Khalid said earlier that a Vietnamese woman and an Indonesian woman wiped a liquid on Kim Jong Nam's face.

Airport camera footage released on Monday by Japanese broadcaster Fuji TV shows the moment the women appeared to assault Kim Jong Nam, who is later seen asking airport officials for medical help.

Absorbed in large doses, it is fatal after 15 minutes, according to the US Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, making it the most toxic known nerve agent in the world.

Malaysia on Thursday requested Interpol to put an alert out to apprehend four North Korean suspects in the murder.

Police are also holding one North Korean man, but are seeking another seven in connection with the murder.

� Reuters file photo

Malaysia on Wednesday charged two women � an Indonesian and a Vietnamese � with murdering the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader in an assassination using a super-toxic nerve agent that killed in minutes.

Siti Aishah, a 25-year-old mother of one from Jakarta, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, from rural northern Vietnam, could be hanged if they are convicted for the killing of Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13.

Aishah and Huong have told diplomats who visited them in custody that they were unwitting pawns in an assassination that US officials and South Korean intelligence have said was organised by North Korean agents.

According to the charges the women and four unnamed people, who are still at large, were at the departure hall of the airport, with intention to murder the North Korean citizen.

One North Korean man, identified by police as Ri Jong Chol, is still in police custody and has not been charged yet.

Malaysian police arrested both women in the days after the attack.

According to the information extracted from the arrestees and the intelligence, one Myanmar national named Bomong and Rohingya national Ayatollah are main kingpins who supply contraband items to the syndicates.

Bomong runs the business from Myanmar while Ayatollah visits Bangladesh at times.

Rab suspects that Ayatollah has already obtained Bangladesh citizenship and national identity card.

Smugglers earlier used coastal routes for the smuggling, but as the law enforcement agencies intensified vigilance in coastal areas of Teknaf and Cox's Bazar, they began taking a detour through deep sea to Barisal and Khulna, Rab said.

If the capacity of Barisal and Khulna battalions is increased, Rab could be more successful in dealing with yaba smugglers, robbers and pirates who hold people hostage in deep sea for ransom, Benazir said.

ZIA-based smuggling ring destroyed stolen artefacts




After five days of artefact theft from Zia International Airport (ZIA), investigators yesterday said a ring of smugglers based at the airport destroyed the precious archaeological masterpieces and dumped them in a dustbin in Uttara.

Rab officials raided dumping grounds, including those at Uttara, Jatrabari, Aminbazar and Savar, and thought to have found some pieces from two dumping grounds in Aminbazar and Savar.

The two 1,500-year-old terracotta statues bound for an exhibition at the Guimet Museum in Paris were stolen while in the custody of Air France at ZIA on December 22.

The statues from the Gupta era had been displayed at the National Museum since they were discovered at Mahasthangarh in Bogra.

Besides arresting 15 persons immediately after the incident, the Rab arrested 10 more people, including a former MP and a former deputy secretary, during the last 24 hours.

Rab sources said five of the arrested were involved with stealing the statues from the airport and they took the artefacts to Abbas' house at 51/E, Road-7B in sector-3 in Uttara on December 22 morning.

Those who witnessed the heinous crime include arrested former MP Anwara Begum Putul, who owns three flats in the same apartment house, Rab said.

The investigation officer of the case produced those who confessed to their involvement with the heinous act before a Dhaka court last evening, he added.

Uttara Zone Deputy Commissioner of Police Khandaker Rafiqul Islam told The Daily Star, "A man named Abbas implemented the whole plan of stealing and destroying the artefacts.

Andre Chenue, the consignee of the artefacts from Paris, nominated the Home Bound Bangladesh to send the artefacts by Air France.

The name of Home Bound Bangladesh was found as the sender agent on the receipt of Association of Cargo Agents of Bangladesh although its officials repeatedly told The Daily Star that they did not book any cargo flight of Air France.

According to the agreement signed between France and Bangladesh, "The Borrower ensures the security of the artefacts in accordance with the security standards applicable to French Museum.

Our court correspondent reports: The 10 arrested persons were produced before the Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate's Court yesterday and seven of them were taken for recording judicial statements.

Three days after the murder, Faruk�s wife Nahar Ahmed filed the case with Tangail model police station.

Amanur landed in jail on September 18, 2016 when he surrendered to a Tangail court in the murder case.

Unlike Rana Plaza where news of the collapse led to worker protests in the industrial areas of Dhaka, where thousands of garment workers walked out, set fire to at least two factories, smashed vehicles and demanded death penalty for the building owner Sohel Rana and the owners of the garment factories (five) located in the building, where workers in neighbouring Narayanganj city vandalised five garment factories, where workers clashed with police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas � nothing happened at Tampaco.

According to an investigation conducted by the Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company, the fire was caused by chemicals which had been stored unsafely.

He was granted anticipatory bail by the High Court on November 21 and instructed to surrender before a lower court.

The Gazipur lower court granted him bail, while five others including his son, were sent to prison.

Workers were not issued any appointment letters, there were no benefit schemes like provident fund, pension or insurance; workers were only issued ID cards with photos, no designation was mentioned.

Horrified, I asked Nargis, �And where�s your husband�s laash now, has he been buried?� �No, no it�s in the DMCH (Dhaka Medical College and Hospital) morgue.

I have a wife and children to feed, there is no factory.� As was the engineer, unsure whether he should pack up and leave for their village home, �The house rent alone is ten thousand taka.�

BAT (British American Tobacco) and Nestle were among Tampaco�s multinational clients, their responses were disgraceful.

Old factory buildings should not be allowed to run, bas.�

The Gazipur district administration called off the joint rescue operation conducted by the army and the fire service a month later.

Lt Col Md Azam of the 14th Independent Engineers Brigade, acting mayor of Gazipur City Corporation Asadur Rahman Kiron, and Gazipur Fire Service Deputy Director Akhteruzzaman were present at the programme.

I had a niggling feeling that the demolition work was handed over to contractors close to the owner, I questioned journalists both local and in Dhaka, but no one seemed to know or was willing to comment.

The cheques were handed out by Md Mujibul Haque, state minister for labour and employment, and Zahid Ahsan Russell MP, also present was the employment ministry secretary Mikail Shiper, and several other high-ranking government officials.

Amidst all this, the Gazipur DC slipped in a reference to Syed Mokbul Hossain in his speech, he is from my nana shoshur�s (wife�s maternal grandfather) village, as I sat awestruck at how the entire programme was managed and coordinated by the Tampaco management (lining up family members to receive cheques, facilitating quick cheque-receipt, prompting the next in line).

Syed Mokbul Hossain has been seen at Dhaka Club, a close friend vouches.

The entire 275 kilometres border in Khulna division is 'sensitive', claimed a Chuadanga police official, seeking anonymity, as the smuggling had seen a significant rise last year.

According to police sources, arms smugglers are particularly active in at least 29 pockets in six bordering districts -- four in Kushtia, five in Jhenaidah, four in Chuadanga, three in Meherpur, six in Satkhira and seven in Jessore.

Last year 14 smuggled firearms were recovered in Kushtia, 24 in Chuadanga, 16 in Jhenaidah, 35 in Meherpur, 16 in Jessore, 13 in Satkhira and 10 in Khulna.

A team of Rab-6 recovered 13 firearms in Meherpur and arrested five suspected arms traders on October 19 last year.

A source in Chuadanga police said Nasirpara and Kacharipara villages of Jalanghi thana in Murshidabad district under West Bengal are among the key places of clandestine arms factories, which are within three kilometres of Meherpur and Chuadanga borders.

Firearms produced at those factories operated by criminal gang are being smuggled into Bangladesh, added the source.

These are mostly made in China, USA and Czech Republic.

During a recent visit to different border points in Meherpur, Chuadanga and Kushtia, this correspondent had an idea about the prices of these firearms.

It is alleged that border guards of India and Bangladesh often ignore routine checks because of underhand dealings.

Different types of arms are being smuggled daily into Bangladesh through its south-western borders, said an illegal arms trader.

Chuadanga police and Rab sources said now only eight to twelve Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) men guard the south-west Border Outposts (BoP), which was 18 to 25 earlier.

�We often arrest some of them and recover firearms, but it is not enough,� Md Nazrul Islam, Chuadanga superintendent of police, told The Daily Star at his office recently adding, police are on the hunt for the gunrunners.

The law enforcement agencies in the region are 'aggressive' and 'pro-active', said Sheikh Hemayat Hossain, deputy inspector general of Khulna police.

Thai man broadcasts baby daughter�s murder live on Facebook
A Thai man filmed himself killing his 11-month-old daughter in two video clips posted on Facebook before committing suicide, police said on Tuesday.

On Tuesday a Swedish court jailed three men for the rape of a woman that was broadcast live on Facebook.

Last week, Facebook said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage and other objectionable material after a posting of the fatal shooting of a man in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours before being taken down.

The harrowing footage from Thailand showed Wuttisan Wongtalay tying a rope to his daughter Natalie's neck before dropping the child, dressed in a bright pink dress, from the rooftop of a deserted building in the seaside town of Phuket.

Thailand's ministry of digital economy said it contacted Facebook on Tuesday afternoon about removing the videos, after receiving a police request.

They cooperated very well.�

After the company faced a backlash for showing the video of the Cleveland killing, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would do all it could to prevent such content in the future.

Thai netizens voiced outrage about the clips of the child's killing, which were uploaded on Monday, the first at 4:50pm (0950 GMT) and the second at 4:57pm (0957 GMT).

�He should have just died alone.�

The killing was the first in Thailand known to be broadcast on the social networking site, said deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen.

�It could be influenced by behavior from abroad, most recently in Cleveland,� Kissana told Reuters.

The California company declined to answer questions about the latest incident or make employees available for interviews.

Wildlife trafficking sees sharp rise
A growing number of seizure of wild animals and birds over the last five years shows that poachers and smugglers are using Bangladesh as a route for wildlife trafficking.

According to wildlife officials, traffickers are active in smuggling out tiger skins and bones through Bangladesh, as those have huge demands on the global market, especially in China.

Wildlife traffickers are illegally bringing wild birds and animals mainly from India to smuggle those out via Shahjalal International Airport in the capital, the officials said.

But we need more support, and need to train our law enforcers and airport officials if we want to stop it.�

About wildlife trafficking via Shahjalal airport, he said, �If tiger skins are smuggled in luggage, it is difficult for scanners to detect those.�

He said wildlife trafficking poses serious threats to the survival of rare and endangered animals such as Bengal tigers in the Sundarbans.

�Seizure of tiger bones is new in Bangladesh.

He said tiger bones are not used in Bangladesh.

�We believe China is the destination of tiger bones since Chinese people use those to make medicine.�

Almost two-thirds of the 21,506 wild birds and animals seized since 2010 are turtles and tortoises.

A large number of the turtles and tortoises, mostly brought from India illegally, were recovered at Shahjalal airport while those were being smuggled to Southeast Asian countries, said forest officials.

According to several Malaysian online pet shops, a tortoise is sold from Tk 5,000 (280 RM) to Tk 13,500 (750 RM), while a pair could cost up to Tk 70,000 (3,888 RM).

On October 4 night, Border Guard Bangladesh seized 169 turtles at Benapole border and arrested a person.

In another joint drive of the Criminal Investigation Department and the DoF on September 6, two tiger skins were seized from a shop named Leather Boutique in the capital's Gulshan area.

In August, law enforcers seized three tiger skins and bones in Satkhira.

On January 4, 2013, law enforcers recovered 10 monkeys and 160 birds of rare species at Shahjalal airport after those were illegally brought in from South Africa.

In the previous year, the WCCU recovered two tusks of African elephants that were to be smuggled to Myanmar.

On July 2, 2010, customs officials seized around 1,000 birds, mostly protected species, from a Pakistani citizen at Shahjalal airport.

The Pakistani national tried to smuggle the birds to his country, putting them inside cartons, said a customs official.

Myanmar orders businesses to repay 'embezzled' cash
Myanmar has ordered state loans totalling tens of millions of dollars to be clawed back from private businesses, in a rare public move to tackle graft in one of the world's most corrupt nations.

Myanmar, which Transparency International last year ranked as the world's third most corrupt country, retains a deep-rooted culture of graft among officials and the military who operated with impunity under the junta.

On a historic visit to Myanmar on Monday US President Barack Obama praised democratic reforms sweeping the nation but warned that graft could undermine efforts to lift the population out of poverty.

"This cycle of economic growth can only be created if corruption is left behind," he said, speaking as the first sitting US leader to visit the once-pariah nation.

"For investment to lead to opportunity, reform must promote budgets that are transparent," he said, adding US businesses expected to flock to Myanmar's newly opened markets would have to meet "high standards" of transparency.

Number of IS fighters killed by US bomb jumps to 90
The number of Islamic State fighters killed by a massive US bomb in eastern Afghanistan has nearly tripled to at least 90, Afghan officials said today.

Afghan officials had earlier said the bombing had killed 36 IS fighters.

An American special forces soldier was killed last Saturday in Nangarhar while conducting anti-IS operations.

But some officials close to him condemned the use of Afghanistan as what they called a testing ground for the weapon, and against a militant group that controls only a tiny sliver of territory and is not considered a huge threat.

IS, notorious for its reign of terror in Syria and Iraq, has made inroads into Afghanistan in recent years, attracting disaffected members of the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban as well as Uzbek Islamists.

But the group has been steadily losing ground in the face of heavy pressure both from US air strikes and a ground offensive led by Afghan forces.

Harunur Rashid, a deputy assistant director of the ACC, filed the case with Ramna Police Station under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code, section 5(2) of the Corruption Prevention Act of 1947 and section 15 of the Emergency Power Rules 2007.

The complainant alleged that on June 9 in 1991, a grant in the amount of $1,255,000, equivalent to about Tk 4.45 crore at the time, was transferred from United Saudi Commercial Bank to Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund -- a fund that was created by then premier Khaleda shortly before the transfer of the grant as part of the embezzlement scheme.

On September 5, 1993, Khaleda, still the prime minister, issued a Tk 2.33-crore cheque from the Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund to the so-called Zia Orphanage Trust on the pretext of building an orphanage in Bogra.

On November 15 the same year, the cheque was deposited into Zia Orphanage Trust account maintained with Sonali Bank's New North Circle Branch at Gulshan in the capital.

Later, Tk 4 lakh was withdrawn from the trust account and Tk 2.77 lakh of it was spent to purchase 2.79 acres of land at Gabtoli in Bogra under the name of Zia Orphanage Trust.

In April, June and July of 2006, Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman, also the chairman of the Zia Orphanage Trust, transferred Tk 3.3 crore from the trust account in six cheques to an FDR (fixed deposit receipt) account opened by his relative Mominur Rahman with Gulshan branch of Prime Bank.

By February 7, 2007, most of the Tk 3.3 crore was again distributed into new FDR accounts opened with Prime Bank's New Eskaton branch at Ramna under the names of Kazi Salimul Haque, Syed Ahmed alias Sayeed Ahmed, Gias Uddin Ahmed and Sharfuddin Ahmed.

Sexual abuse both by male students and teachers in different universities of Bangladesh has become a matter of concern.

The man has been identified as Latif Rony, a student of Government Titumir College in Dhaka.

Besides, the activists have also identified sympathisers of the culprits as one Bappy Biswas, a student of Dhaka University.

Moreover, the tide of social awareness creating posts are seen on groups like Desperately Seeking Dhaka (DSD), whereby users are sharing ideas on how to protect girls from being harassed, and also sharing information through which the trouble makers may be caught.

On May 7, Ferdous confessed before a Dhaka court that he sexually harassed his female students.

Earlier in the day, Afroz Irene Koli, sub-inspector of Women Support and Investigation Division of Kalabagan Police Station and investigation officer (IO) of the case, produced him before the court on completion of a two-day remand, seeking the court order to send him to jail.

The same day, the court of Metropolitan Magistrate Delwar Hussain placed him on a two-day remand rejecting his bail prayer in a case filed with Kalabagan Police Station.

On May 6, five AUST female students, who allegedly fell victim of sexual harassment by their teacher Ferdous, testified before separate courts in Dhaka in connection with the case.

RU teacher forced into retirement on 'sexual harassment' charge
Rajshahi University authorities have sent Prof Dr Kamrul Hasan Majumdar, a teacher of the Department of Geology and Mining, into forced retirement on charge of "sexually harassing" a female student of the university.

Earlier on the day, a team of Kalabagan Police Station arrested Mahfuzur Rashid Ferdous, associate professor of the EEE department, from his flat in the city�s Eskatan area.

During that investigation, more than two dozen women described harassment by Ailes, according to New York Magazine.

A court filing showed Carlson, 50, had voluntarily dismissed her federal lawsuit in New Jersey against Ailes.

INDECENCY AND MISOGYNY

Fox News still is fighting sexual harassment claims in a New York state court.

The speed with which Fox settled with Carlson suggested it may settle with Tantaros, said Dan Eaton, a San Diego State University business ethics lecturer and employment attorney.

A $20 million settlement is high for a sexual harassment case but not surprising given the high profile of the people involved, said Douglas Wigdor, a New York City employment lawyer who represents employees.

New York magazine reported in July that Kelly had told investigators hired by Fox that Ailes "made unwanted sexual advances toward her" about 10 years ago.

Blasts kill 5 amid raid
Two powerful bombs went off at separate places near a militant den in Sylhet, killing five people, including two policemen, and injuring 40 others, even as joint forces were raiding the hideout for a second straight day yesterday.

�The Islamic State's Amaq News Agency reported that the group is responsible for a bombing on Bangladeshi forces in Sylhet,� SITE said on its website.

IS' 'Amaq Reports IS Bombing on Bangladeshi Forces in Sylhet https://t.co/sEi31qsymi � SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) March 25, 2017

The Bangladesh government denies that IS has presence in the country.

Earlier in the day, Para Commandos from Sylhet division evacuated 78 residents who had been trapped inside the building since early hours Friday.

Police tracked down the hideout barely a week after busting two militant dens in Chittagong.

Later around 2:04pm, armoured vehicles of Bangladesh Army broke through the boundary wall of the building, reports our Sylhet correspondent.

Akhtar Hossain, officer-in-charge of Jalalabad Police Station, said, around 1:30pm on Friday, the female militant suspect yelled from a window of the flat: �Bring SWAT quickly because you [police] won't be able to do anything to us� We don't have much time.�

Later, SWAT team and bomb disposal unit of counterterrorism unit went there from Dhaka.

It was for the first time after last year's Gulshan attack that army commandos have been called in to take on militants.

Two people -- Wahidul Islam Opu, a college student in South Surma Upazila, and an unidentified man -- died in this attack, police and hospital sources said.

But we soon noticed people running here and there in panic,� said our Moulvibazar correspondent.

The dead are Chowdhury Abu Mohammad Kaiser, an inspector of court police in Sylhet, Monirul Islam, inspector (investigation) of Jalalabad Police Station, and Shahidul Islam of Dariapara in Sylhet city, police said.

The injured, including several law enforcers, were rushed to Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital.

They were flown to the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka, Brig Gen Md Ruhul Amin, director of the hospital in Sylhet, told this correspondent.

Malaysia Airlines crew member accused of sexual harassment
An aircraft of Malaysian Airline System taxis on the tarmac at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang outside Kuala Lumpur in this February 26, 2007 Reuters file photo.

Beleaguered Malaysia Airlines today admitted it is working with French authorities after one of its cabin crew members was accused of sexual harassment on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Paris, reports Travel Pulse.

The alleged incident happened on August 4 on Flight MH 320.

An Australian woman had expressed her fear of flying to the crew on Malaysia Airlines after the two tragic incidents involving the carrier that took place earlier this year.

In a statement released today, the carrier said �Malaysia Airlines can confirm that following allegations by a passenger travelling on flight MH20 from Kuala Lumpur to Paris on 4th August 2014 of inappropriate sexual behavior by a member of the cabin crew, the member of staff in question has been detained for questioning by the French police.

Malaysia Airlines expects and accepts nothing short of the highest standards of conduct from its crew and takes any such allegations very seriously.

We will naturally assist the French authorities as they conduct their investigation and would stress that the safety, comfort and well-being of our passengers is always our highest priority.�

It�s another blow in what has been a tragic few months for the airline.

Malaysia Airlines had been in financial straits for at least three years prior to the dual tragedies that beset the carrier this year.

In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

Last week, With no buyers or merger offer, the financially plagued airline said it will be taken over by the Malaysian government.

The airline�s stock will be delisted from the Malaysian Stock Exchange as one of the government�s private wealth funds, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, offered to buy out minority shareholders in a $429 million restructuring plan for the national carrier.

Youths launch campaign for dowry-free marriage
A campaign for dowry-free marriage has been launched in Dilpasha union under Bhangura upazila, thanks to the initiative of some local youths and the chairman of the union.

The body of Alo was sent to the Narayanganj General Hospital morgue for an autopsy.

Being disgusted, Khuku along with three daughters, came to her parents' house at Uttar Bhatkhawa village under Dewanganj upazila about a week ago, Lovely said.

Contacted, Bakshiganj police station officer in-charge (OC) Fazlul Karim said they recovered the body and sent it to Jamalpur General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

This interesting news item from Patna in India was published in the pages of a local English daily on May 18th.

It adds a new twist to the saga of dowry demands; common in India!

Portable Gen-Sets are a new item in the menu of dower demands claimed by the groom's parents, in power starved state of Bihar in India!

Considering the bleak power situation in Bangladesh now, may be this could be an interesting idea for prospective groom's parents in negotiating the items for dowry for marriage of their son.

Most of our illegal trade is with India through the porous border.

In fact, roughly 70 percent of the total imports from India come through land ports in western and eastern zones to convey the message that most of the smuggling between Bangladesh and India is through land ports.

Not only Bangladesh, but other countries are also scared of bootleg smuggling of alcohols, tobacco, drugs etc.

If one could carry some cartons of cigarettes from US to Canada, the costs of travel could easily be recouped.

Or a few bottles of wine from France to England might allow a comfortable stay in London.

Historically, Bangladesh's illegal imports from India have hovered around 30 times more that its illegal exports to India.

My research a couple of years back on smuggling showed that, of the total illegal imports from India, 70 per cent is "technical smuggling" and only 30 percent is "bootleg smuggling."

If illegal imports from India are 70 percent of legal trade, then total illegal trade can be approximated at $1.4 billion per year.

By consuming smuggled goods of bootleg type, we are in fact paying taxes to the Indian government.

Such smuggled goods carry central and state taxes of India at retail level.

Had these been formalised through legal imports, there would be no such taxes from Indian side and Bangladesh government would get taxes through tariffs.

Wife strangled for dowry in Barisal
A woman was strangled by her husband for dowry at Hizla-Gourabdi in Hizala upazila yesterday, police and locals said.

Police recovered the body at noon and sent it to Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital morgue for autopsy.

Nila was married to one Akbar Hossain, an ex-expatriate from Saudi Arabia.

Today, March 3rd, I read another sad story in the Daily Star, about a 22 years old housewife, with a 3 year old, child who died at Dhaka Medical College hospital on February 22.

After six months, Manik and his family demanded Tk One lakh again for sending Manik to Saudi Arabia.

These sorts of news reports from Bangladesh are the worst sorts of criminal stories one can read about in the Bangladeshi media.

We know life is tough and poverty is rampant but Bangladesh was never such a land of criminals as it is today than it was, say 35 years ago, even though economically the country is much better off than it ever has been.

Corruption and criminality seem to be the way of life in Bangladesh.

Let Bangladesh government and the civil society ponder for a while, and let them do something to cure, at least, the two above mentioned diseases.

But in a country like Bangladesh, and when acid throwing and setting fire to women have become common, I strongly recommend that capital punishment be the only punishment for such crimes.

Girls from Bangladesh's Hindu community were the victims of this crime for centuries.

There should be laws, if there are no such laws as yet in Bangladesh, that forbid acid throwing, setting fire and dowry taking.

It is time that Bangladesh learns to respect and protect her woman folk.

Many Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal, follow the practice of dowry.

The social customs in Bangladesh are such that in the 21st century a husband consumed by greed can brutally murder his wife when her family cannot meet the dowry demand.

We read and hear about horrific dowry-related deaths in Bangladesh.

This is happening today in Bangladesh.

It is well documented that since the independence of Bangladesh the dowry problem has become more acute.

Despite the passing of such laws dowry related violence has increased in Bangladesh.

Housewife murdered for dowry
A housewife was killed allegedly by her husband for dowry at Borhanpur village under Madhabpur upazila of Habiganj on Tuesday.

Family members took him to Madhabpur Upazila Health Complex, where the doctors declared her to dead.

Sub-inspector Kamrul Islam of Madhabpur Police Station police arrested Rais on Wednesday night, following a case filed by the victim's father accusing Hossain and his parents.

This was the culmination of the torture Ripa Rani Pandit, 23, had been suffering since her marriage with Ratan Pandit, of Adompur in Kotiadi upazila under Kishoreganj district, nearly eight months back.

Ratan stood nearby as the tragedy unfolded on Sunday, said Ripa's maternal aunt Baby Pandit who has been attending to her at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

Ripa's in-laws Rabindra Pandit and Kalyani Pandit themselves took her to a Kishoreganj hospital and then shifted her to DMCH on Monday.

Ripa's father who has a small clothing store at Netrokona gave her in-laws Tk 1.1 lakh and two tolas of gold ornament while marrying her off to Ratan, said her brother Opu at the hospital.

The victim, Habiba Khatun, 16, daughter of Hafizur Rahman of Dakkhin Kalitola in Naogaon municipality, is now battling for her life at the bed of Naogaon General Hospital.

She secured GPA-5 in her PSC and JSC and was to attend SSC examinations from PM Girls' High School in Naogaon as a science group candidate this year, but could not, said the father.

After six days, Habiba's parents found her at the house of a relative of her husband in Rajshahi.

"We admitted her to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH) where she stayed in life support for 16 days," said the father.

"We took her home in Naogaon from RMCH.

But she was admitted to Naogaon General Hospital on February 24 as her condition was deteriorating.

"Dr Arshad Hossain of the hospital said my daughter needs to be taken to Dhaka immediately for proper treatment," said Habiba's father.

"The girl's father filed a case with Naogaon Sadar Police Station on February 6 accusing Ovi and his parents.

Police have already arrested Ovi and his father and trying to arrest Ovi's mother who has gone into hiding," said Md Tariqul Islam, officer in charge of Naogaon Sadar Police Station.

Judge Md Rafiqul Islam of Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal delivered the verdict against Kanchon Halder, 35, son of Dulal Halder of Vati Luxmipur area in Faridpur town.

The victim's father filed a case with Faridpur Sadar Police Station on that day.

Petrol bomb on bus again
Eight people were burned, two of them badly, in Comilla yesterday in a mindless petrol bomb attack on a running bus, bringing to mind the disturbing images of such attacks during the BNP-led opposition's countrywide blockade early this year.

The attack near Bangladesh Jute Research Centre on Dhaka-Chittagong highway at Chandina happened around midnight, when most of the people were offering Shab-e-Barat prayers.

Police detained two local Jamaat leaders for questioning, said Shah Abid Hossain, superintendent of Comilla police.

They are taking treatment at the intensive care unit of the burn unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

Zahirul Islam and Lovely Akhter, a couple from Narayanganj, took primary treatment at Comilla Medical College Hospital, Comilla police said quoting doctors there.

The Unique Paribahan bus, with around 40 people on board, was heading from Dhaka to Rangamati, said Abid.

I escaped through the door as the front part was not on fire,� he told this correspondent at the DMCH, adding that the bus left had Dhaka around 9:45pm.

At that time, several attacks took place in different parts of Comilla.

THE VICTIMS

Critically injured Anjan is an adviser at Bishwo Shahitto Kendro and Ranjit a teacher at Rangamati Government Women's College.

The other victims are Imran Hossain, an LGED employee (15 percent burns); Suman Chandra Nath, a textile engineer of Rangamati (15 percent burns); Khokon Chakma of Rangamati (16 percent burns) and Bazlur Rahman, a day labourer of Jhenidah (four percent burns).

His younger brother Ranjan Dey said for the last few weeks Anjan had been travelling to Rangamati frequently to see their ailing mother.

Meanwhile, officials of police, Rab and Border Guard Bangladesh held a meeting at Chandina Police Station in the afternoon and decided to launch a joint operation to hunt down the attackers, reports a Comilla correspondent.

The 24-year-old victim, Radharani Chowhan seemed to have stopped talking as The Daily Star correspondent visited her at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH) where she has been undergoing treatment.

Daughter of late Harilal Chowhan, of Kacharipara in Nalitabari upazila of Sherpur district, Radha married Arun Chowhan, son of Sreeprasad Chowhan of Haluaghat upazila in Mymensingh, nearly six years ago.

Hearing Radha scream, people from the neighbourhood rushed to the spot and took her to Haluaghat Upazila Health Complex.

She was immediately shifted to the MMCH as her condition was critical, Sanjib said, adding that Arun himself took her to Mymensingh but after her admission to the hospital, he fled.

Meanwhile, Sanjib lodged a case with Haluaghat Police Station against Arun's father Sreeprasad, mother Joysna Chowhan and younger brother Barun Chowhan.

The arrestees were then produced before a Mymensingh court that sent them to jail.

In-laws' brutality for dowry
A housewife and her infant daughter were confined to a locked room for five days without food by her husband and his mother at Khutamara village under Jaldhaka upazila of the district.

Dimla upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) rescued them yesterday after hearing of the matter from some local people.

�On that night, my husband went to Dhaka with his lover and started living there in a relative's rented house passing as a married couple.

Learning of the matter from some local youths, Jaldhaka UNO Rasedul Huq Prodhan directed the Khutamara Union Parishad (UP) chairman and village police to rescue them, but they failed.

�I rescued the housewife and her minor daughter, who were very weak, and sent them to Dimla Upazila Health Complex,� the UNO said, adding that the culprits must be brought to book.

Officer-in-Charge (investigation) of Jaldhaka Police Station Mofiz uddin said the victim's family is preparing to file a complaint with the police station.

Tushti, a first-semester student of MBA at Dhaka University, was admitted to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital after her in-laws tortured her for dowry in front of her mother and brother who were assaulted as well.

Sakhawat Hossain Shohag, a police officer in Narsingdi, has been jailed for torturing his wife for more dowry.

DOWRY IN BANGLADESH

The practice of dowry is one of the most evil forms of social ills to pervade Bangladeshi society.

Bangladesh, where a quarter of the 160 million population lives below $2 per day, poverty, lack of education and the low status of women are inherently tied to one another.

Dowry in South Asia and in Bangladesh can be classified into three categories.

In Bangladesh's context, dowry includes money, jewellery, furniture, household items, cars, apartment, land, expenses, etc, either paid voluntarily or on demand to the groom's family.

CHILD MARRIAGE AND DOWRY

The spate of dowry-related deaths and torture cannot be separated from the epidemic of child marriage in Bangladesh.

UNICEF ranks Bangladesh fourth highest in the world when it comes to the rate of child marriage.

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods and droughts are a common occurrence in Bangladesh and it's not uncommon for the poverty-stricken, who are particularly vulnerable to such phenomena, to lose their livelihood, land, and property in the aftermath of such unfortunate events.

Cricketer Sunny surrenders, gets bail in dowry case
Cricketer Arafat Sunny secured bail after he surrendered before a Dhaka court today in connection with a dowry case filed by a woman who claims to be his wife.

After hearing the complaint, Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Raihan Ul Islam summoned him to appear before the court today (April 5).

On the same day, another Dhaka court placed Sunny on a one-day remand in another case filed in January by Nasrin Sultana under Information and Communication Technology Act.

But the single image of Fatema Akter Liya of Tangail, her shaven head exposing grievous injuries, in this newspaper, sums up everything that has gone wrong with our society.

After hearing the case complaint, Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate MD Raihan Ul Islam summoned the cricketer to appear before it on April 5 for hearing.

SUNNY DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN REMAND

During remand today, Arafat Sunny denied all allegations placed against him and claimed he did not send Nasrin Sultana any photos, said Md Yahia, investigation officer of the case filed under ICT act.

MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE DEEMED FAKE

There is no marriage registrar's office in the location, 20/B Meradia in Dhaka�s Khilgaon area, mentioned in the marriage certificate that the plaintiff earlier produced before the court as evidence of her claim.

As per the draft law, one would face maximum life-term sentence or up to 12 years' imprisonment and fine for seriously hurting a woman over dowry, Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam told reporters after the cabinet approved the proposed law at its weekly meeting at the Bangladesh Secretariat.

Mitali Jahan of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) said there are already such provisions of punishments in the Women and Children Repression Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) about provoking someone to commit suicide or injuring someone.

Brutalities for dowry
It is unfortunate that after long 45 years of Independence, Bangladeshi women are still facing various forms of gender discrimination and gender-based violence in their everyday life.

In the most recent case a man cut off his wife's tongue and slashed the tendon of her left leg for Tk 5 lakh dowry in Sylhet.

The statistics along with the shocking tale of brutality speak aloud about the vulnerability of Bangladeshi women in the domestic sphere.

'JMB's bomb expert' arrested in city
Rapid Action Battalion claimed to have arrested an improvised explosive device (IED) expert of Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in the capital's Uttara early yesterday.

Son of a late civil engineer of Comilla's Burichang, Mushfiqur got admitted to computer science and engineering department at Buet in 2005, but did not complete his studies.

The 15 JMB men's target was a government establishment near Dhaka Cantonment, Jahangir claimed.

Following the arrest of his associates, Mushfiqur went into hiding in Sylhet and Brahmanbaria, said Rab.

On information, a team of Rab-10 arrested him from his house in Sector-12 of Uttara around 8:30am.

Responding to a question whether Mushfiqur had any connection with the bomb explosion near Atia Mahal during army-led Operation Twilight in Sylhet, the Rab official said they would interrogate him about the issue.

Dipak Kumar Das, a sub-inspector of the Detective Branch of police, who headed the investigation into the case, filed the report with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate�s Court of Dhaka this afternoon.

The joyous celebration of the Bangalee's biggest festival -- Pahela Baishakh -- was tainted by incidents of sexual assault on women on the Dhaka University campus on the evening of April 14 this year, sparking widespread public outrage.

Witnesses said some 30 to 40 rowdy youths assaulted and sexually harassed around 20 women for about one hour at the Suhrawardy Udyan gate near the TSC area around 6:00pm.

However, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mohammad Asaduzzaman Miah claimed no incident of sexual assault took place on the campus on Tuesday.

DMP installed around 19 CCTV cameras in the Shahbagh area with three to four cameras positioned right around the spot, said Sirajul Islam, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station.

Liton Nandi, president of Bangladesh Chhatra Union's DU unit, said a group of youths tore off almost the whole of a 25-year-old woman's clothes in front of the Suhrawardy Udyan gate.

One-third of Japanese working women sexually harassed: survey
One-third of Japanese working women have experienced sexual harassment at their place of employment, though nearly two-thirds of these women suffer in silence, a survey has showed.

The results of the first-of-its-kind study commissioned by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to support working women to kickstart the country's struggling economy.

Economists have said for years that Japan needs to make better use of its well-educated but underemployed women, which could go a long way toward plugging the country's labour gap as the country faces an ageing and declining population.

In speech after speech, Abe has urged the country to open up to "womenomics", encouraging some of Japan's biggest firms -- including Toyota, Panasonic and All Nippon Airways -- to announce targets for boosting the number of female executives.

Japan was ranked 101 out of 145 in the Global Gender Gap Index 2015, released by World Economic Forum, lower than Suriname and Azerbaijan.

Following the case filed by an AUST alumnus, Kalabagan police arrested him the same day.

Kandirhat High School assistant teacher Nurul Haque allegedly harassed the four students of class X of the school on different days after private tuition at his house.

Dhaka University as an independent body, it could take necessary steps to prevent such occurrences to ensure a secure environment for female students, said Executive Director of Steps Towards Development Ranjan Karmakar.

The survey, jointly done by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and United Nations Population Fund, covered all the seven divisions of the country.

"My friend was nearly raped the other day," said Shejuti Hridi, a student at a Chittagong university.

Asked for her comments, Ayesha Khanam, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said women's attire was not the issue here.

Ruma, an official in a private company in the capital, said she nearly broke down in tears on a bus recently because when she tried to get a seat reserved for women from a man occupying it, he flung degrading comments at her.

Anamika Alam of Barabkunda village of Sitakunda in Chittagong told The Daily Star that the situation was just the same in the villages.

Street Harassment is Still Serious:

The violation of women in

Dhaka's public realm



Sexual harassment on the streets is also a form of violence, argues OLINDA HASSAN.

Zahedul I Khan The laws governing violence against women have made their presence in Bangladesh.

Violence against women has a history in Bangladesh.

It is also something that women face worldwide; The Egyptian Center for Women's Rights reported that 83% of their women faced street harassment at least once in their life, and similar statistics were found for South Africa, Mexico and France, to name a few.

With urbanisation and the rapid population growth in Dhaka, women inevitably become more prominent in the streets.

This trend is certainly a triumph in the modern women's movement of Bangladesh.

It is very evident therefore, that the ratio of the two genders in the streets of Dhaka is still overwhelmingly in favour of men.

As one male student in his third year at Dhaka University (anonymous) explained after asking him about street harassment, �these women are not supposed to be in the streets, so of course they are going to get harassed.

Bryony Beynon from London of HollaBack, a worldwide technology-driven anti-harassment movement that first began in New York explained to The Guardian (March 8, 2011) how "people need to understand that street harassment has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with power."

Aisha Zakira, the founder of HollaBack in Mumbai in their press release explained how street harassment incidents �are rarely reported, and are culturally accepted as 'the price you pay' for being a woman and living in a city like Mumbai.� She further went on to explain how this type of violence is a �gateway crime� which creates a �cultural environment which makes gender-based violence okay,� and how while a legal method exists in countries like India and Bangladesh to tackle abuse at work or home, �when it comes to the streets -- all bets are off.� Women are also being told to ignore by other women, as commonly observed by mothers and other older female family members.

Let us assume that public transportation has suddenly become much safer in Bangladesh, for men and women: the rate of hijacking, robbery and threat has significantly decreased, if any at all still occur.

This question must be asked because, along with violence against women being part of the country's history, oppressing women by forcing preventative measures (such as ignoring violators) have also become rooted in the historical culture of Bangladesh.

Women are increasingly sharing the household income and participating in higher education in Dhaka, a city that is also urbanising at a rapid rate and in a suffocating way.

The consequence of ignorance is the continuation of a type of crime that while it may not be considered violent, is as cruel as any other form of violence against women in Dhaka today.

7 killed in suicide bomb attack at Pakistan court
At least seven people were killed when multiple Taliban suicide bombers attacked a court complex in northern Pakistan yesterday, the latest in a series of assaults which have raised fears militants are regrouping.

The attack was claimed by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) faction of the Pakistani Taliban, which carried out a series of apparently coordinated assaults last week including a powerful bomb blast in Lahore which killed 14 people.

Earlier this month the group vowed a fresh offensive on targets in Pakistan including the judiciary.

Lawyers and the judiciary are frequent targets in Pakistan.

Police and troops had been on high alert in Pakistan after last week's wave of attacks, which killed more than 100 people.

Most, including the Lahore bomb, were claimed by JuA, a faction of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, or Pakistani Taliban) group.

The emergence of IS and a TTP resurgence would be a major blow to Pakistan, which had enjoyed a dramatic improvement in security over the past two years after a military-led crackdown begun in 2014.

Islamabad launched a violent crackdown in the wake of the recent attacks, saying it killed dozens of "terrorists" and carried out strikes on militant hideouts along the border with Afghanistan.

Two detained in Philippines in online child abuse raid: officials
Four minors have been rescued and two suspects detained in the Philippines following a raid on an apartment where children were made to disrobe for Internet cameras, the judicial officials said yesterday.

The Manila raid followed a tip-off from the United States Department of Homeland Security, said Dante Bonoan, anti-human trafficking division chief of the justice department's National Bureau of Investigation.

"The exploited minors were asked to show their sex parts to their clients," he told reporters, adding that the website's paid subscribers were mostly from the United States, Canada and European countries.

Police say the Philippines is a key centre of the fast-growing global industry that streams live images of children forced to commit sex acts for paedophiles abroad, with thousands of children in the impoverished nation abused.

Police in Britain, Australia and the Philippines announced last month that they had jointly dismantled a paedophile ring that streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children as young as six over the web.

In a statement, SNAP said members from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States had travelled to The Hague to urge prosecutors to investigate the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

Huckle faces life sentences for Malaysia child abuse
A British man is facing multiple life sentences for numerous sex crimes against Malaysian children which he boasted about on the "dark web".

The 91 charges related to 23 children from mainly poor communities in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.

Huckle, a practising Christian, first visited Malaysia on a teaching gap year when he was 18 or 19.

It is rapidly increasing their vulnerability towards online sexual abuse in Bangladesh.

Bangladeshi school students are more likely to adhere to peer pressure in using internet and hence getting exploited online.

Pakistan probes child abuse scandal
Seven people have been arrested in eastern Pakistan on suspicion of involvement in a child sexual abuse and extortion scandal.

Child sex abuse is widespread in parts of Pakistan, especially in the countryside.

Saba Sadiq, the head of Punjab's child protection bureau, described the case as "the largest child abuse scandal in Pakistan's history", the AFP news agency reports.

Alarming rise in child killing
The rate of children being killed in the country had increased by 61 percent in 2014 than that of the previous year, according to a statistics of Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum (BSAF) and it's not looking good at all for this year either.

Following the recent gruesome murders of three children, NGOs, law enforcers, rights organisations and international organisations have expressed serious concern over child abuse in Bangladesh.

Thirteen-year-old Samiul Alam Rajon was beaten to death in Sylhet last month; twelve-year-old Rakib was tortured to death in Khulna on August 3, as two men inserted a high-pressure air pump nozzle into his rectum; and 10-year-old Rabiul was beaten to death for �stealing fish� in Barguna on Wednesday.

Besides, the body of a minor boy, aged around eight to nine years, was found in an abandoned travel bag in front of Dhaka Medical College Hospital last week.

Bangladesh is no exception to this evil.

In Bangladesh's context, child sexual abuse is still a taboo and seldom gets openly discussed like child labour, trafficking, and exploitation in general.

A joint study conducted by Save the Children and Bangladesh Protibondhi Foundation in 2010 revealed that disabled children are usually at a higher risk of getting sexually harassed as they are unable to protect themselves and even at greater risk are those who are intellectually challenged since they are unable to make out the difference between good and bad touches and are often unable to articulate their concerns.

A seminal and shocking study in the Indian context, "Bitter Chocolate" by Pinki Virani, challenges this belief.

A recent research in India reports that 53% of the children are victims of sexual abuse in some form or the other.

However, one of the biggest challenges that Bangladesh faces in this regard is the lack of professional skills, underscored by lack of institutions providing applied psychology courses, and dearth of professionals working on child psychology.

In 1990, Bangladesh ratified the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which is based on the four general principles of non-discrimination, best interest of the child, right to life, survival and development and right to participation.

IS claims Hossaini Dalan bomb attack: SITE Intel
Terrorist outfit Islamic State (IS)has claimed the responsibility of bomb attacks on Hossaini Dalan, the headquarters of Shiite Muslim group in Bangladesh capital � Dhaka, US-based SITE Intelligence Group said today.

But it is the first time that they have come under such an attack in Bangladesh.

SITE Intelligence Group, a for-profit Maryland-based company that tracks online activity of White supremacist and jihadi organisations, had earlier reported that said IS claimed the responsibility for the murders of two foreign nationals in Bangladesh � Italian Cesare Tavella and Japanese Kunio Hoshi.

The Tweet was posted around 4:00pm Saturday afternoon, nearly 14 hours after the bombings took place in Huseni Dalan � the holy gathering place for Shia Muslims in Dhaka.

STRING OF IS ALARM FROM SITE INTEL GROUP

Though the group has repeatedly raised alarms of presence of Islamic State in Bangladesh, the government high-ups have ruled out the terrorist outfit's existence in the country.

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan was visited by envoys of US, UK, Australia and Canada a few days ago where the official again assured of IS' absence in Bangladesh.

However, they remained fearful of "credible threat" in Bangladesh.

UK, AUSTRALIA UPDATE TRAVEL ALERT

The UK and Australia have updated travel warnings for their citizens in Bangladesh after the attack.

"Current advice to keep a low profile in all public space remains," the UK government told its citizens citing the Huseni Dalan attack.

The Australian government asked its citizens in Bangladesh to travel only by vehicle for the time being.

Fonda, 79, a long-time outspoken advocate of women's rights, said it had taken her years to stand up for herself in Hollywood on issue such as pay and the roles she took.

Fonda, who won Oscars for "Klute" and "Coming Home" in the 1970s, was a leading Hollywood activist at that time, opposing the Vietnam War and supporting the emerging women's movement.

For years she was known as "Hanoi Jane" for her left-wing views and visiting North Vietnam.

But in other areas of her life, such as the Hollywood pay gap where women are often paid less than male stars, Fonda was far from militant.

The less talked about abuse of children
The NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children), UK defines child abuse as any action that causes significant harm to a child, be it physical, sexual, or emotional.

Perhaps as a result of such consequences, corporal punishment in schools was made illegal in Bangladesh in 2011 by the High Court, as a result of the litigation by the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and Ain o Salish Kendro.

And yet, 82.3 percent of children aged 1-14 experienced some form of violent punishment within one month of a survey conducted in 2013 by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and UNICEF.

She is a 38-year-old woman who suffered from paranoia about her husband having an affair for a long time,� says Shilpi Rahman, a mental health counsellor currently based in Qatar.

My mother is someone who cannot stand fat people, so she had this habit of berating my appearance,� shares a student of a private university in Dhaka.

Nehrin Radeyha Rafique, a student of IBA at Dhaka University, recalls the constant humiliation she faced in school.

Sir Frank Peters, a royal goodwill ambassador and a lifelong champion for eliminating corporal punishment in Bangladesh says, �I believe involving the police, criminal charges, convictions, jailing and so on, should be a last resort.

British national arrested for abusing child
Police arrested a British national in Dhopadighirpar area of Sylhet city yesterday on charge of abusing a 15-year-old boy for about a year.

Police said Peter fled Dhaka to Sylhet and was staying in a rented room of the hotel since September 3.

Sylhet Metropolitan Police Commissioner AB Barua said they made the arrest following a five-hour raid along with a magistrate and British High Commission officials.

Barua said Peter took the advantage of poverty and allured the boy hailing from Naogaon under Shulla upazila, Sunamganj over a year ago.

He took the boy on short trips to Bandarban, Dhaka, and other districts and to Nepal, the official quoted the boy as saying on instant quizzing.

The boy, who claimed to be a student of class VI in Shulla upazila, admitted the man's foul behaviour, the SMP commissioner said.

Hailing from Bow area of Mile End, London, UK, Peter claimed himself as a documentary filmmaker on children.

Sylhet Kotwali Police Station Sub-inspector Ikhtiar Uddin filed a case against Peter under "Nari O Shishu Nirjaton Ain".

Duncan Brown, second secretary, political affairs, British high Commission, Dhaka, who was present during the raid, declined to say anything about the arrest.

Vatican receives 600 abuse cases a yr
The Vatican's new chief prosecutor against clerical child abuse on Tuesday said his office was receiving around 600 new cases a year, many of them dating back to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

Catholic higher-ups in many dioceses including in Ireland and the US were accused of covering up abuse for decades and simply moving alleged abusers from one parish to another.

Hundreds of cases of sexual and physical abuse of youths by priests in recent decades have come to light in Europe and the United States as investigations encourage long-silent victims to finally go public with their complaints.

Benedict himself has been accused of turning a blind eye in 1980, when he was archbishop of Munich in his native Germany, to the case of a priest who was sent there for therapy after sexually abusing children and soon transferred to parish work.

The Vatican has said a subordinate took that decision.

SCREENING CANDIDATES

In his sermon, the 83-year-old pope, who met abuse victims in the United States, Australia and Malta and has decried "sin within the Church," also promised that the Church would enact stronger controls on choosing men who enter the priesthood.

The scandal has hit Catholic communities in the United States, Ireland, Belgium and Germany particularly hard.

A poll two months ago in Germany showed that a majority of people had lost confidence in the Church and about a quarter of the country's Catholics are considering quitting.

Child abuse scandals in the United States about eight years ago wreaked havoc on the reputation and finances of the US Catholic Church, which paid some $2 billion in settlements and several dioceses declared bankruptcy.

Luckily, Chittagong's Takrim Hossain Sourav, a class five student, was at least spared his life, he still had to endure severe torture and abuse, which not only caused mental trauma but also respiratory disorder and other physical problems in the child.

CHILD ABUSE IN RAJSHAHI

Dil Sitara Begum Chuni, president of Rajshahi divisional chapter of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association, said child abuse was occurring due to a lack of public awareness and impunity to the abusers.

�The law enforcers often show apathy in quickly responding to the incidents.�

On February 14, locals tortured Ariful Islam, 12, in Puthia, accusing him of stealing a phone SIM card.

IS car bomb kills 51 in Syria's Al-Bab
An Islamic State car bomb killed 51 people yesterday in a rebel-held village near the Syrian town of Al-Bab, sources in the region and a war monitor said, a day after the jihadist group was driven from its last stronghold in the area.

The blast devastated the twin command posts and also seriously wounded a large number of fighters in the village of Susian, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

He said rebel fighters, Turkish soldiers, and civilians from Al-Bab had called a meeting in Susian "to organise a security apparatus and set a plan for rebuilding al-Bab."

Meanwhile, Turkey said yesterday Turkish armed forces and allied Syrian rebels have completely taken the IS bastion of Al-Bab in northern Syria from jihadists.

GENEVA TALKS

The first full day of a fresh round of Syria peace talks began in Geneva yesterday, underlining the fragile state of a ceasefire on the ground.

The UN's Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura, who brought regime and opposition delegates symbolically together to launch the talks late Thursday, held separate meetings with them yesterday to hammer out the format for the meetings.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was "encouraged that the Syrians ... sat together in the same room," his spokesman in New York said, even if it remains unclear whether the two sides will actually hold face-to-face negotiations.

"While acknowledging that progress will not be easy, (Guterres) believes strongly that only a political solution can bring peace to Syria and that all those Syrians who have committed themselves to this goal should redouble their efforts for peace," he added.

IRAQI FORCE STRIKES IS TARGETS

The Iraqi air force struck Islamic State group targets inside neighbouring Syria, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said yesterday in a statement.

"We ordered the air force command to strike Daesh terrorist sites in Husseibeh and Albu Kamal, in Syrian territory," he said, using an Arabic acronym for the jihadist organisation.

A security official speaking on condition of anonymity said it was the first time Iraq aircraft hunted IS targets across the border with Syria.

Half of UK police forces do not record such cases and many local authorities are also unable to provide figures.

Ibidapo's story: 'I felt like a nobody'

Ibidapo was trafficked to the UK from Nigeria in 2007, to work as a servant for relatives in the North of England.

She escaped with the help of a Nigerian woman living nearby.

Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information (FoI) request reveal that half of UK police forces do not routinely record cases.

Only two forces other than the Met have reported incidents over the last three years: Greater Manchester and Northamptonshire each had one case.

A separate FoI request to local councils across the UK revealed 31 cases where a child had been accused of witchcraft or possession by spirits in 2014 - 30 in England and one in Wales.

She is concerned about the lack of awareness among childcare professionals in the UK.

2 kids tortured inhumanly
In yet another incident of cruelty against kids, two teen boys were tortured badly in Rajshahi over a flimsy claim that they may have stolen a mobile phone.

Zahid, a class-ten student at Bagsara High School, was admitted to Poba Upazila Health Complex and Emon, an orphan, went into hiding in fear, said Shariful Islam, officer-in-charge of Poba Police Station.

Police constable Sagar, who is currently with Rab, and a member of Bangladesh Army, Nasir Uddin, also took part in the beating and were seen in the footage, said the OC, quoting locals.

On July 8 last year, 13-year-old Samiul Alam Rajon was beaten to death by a group of men in Sylhet Sadar allegedly for trying to steal a rickshaw van.

On November 8, a Sylhet court handed down death penalty to four people for the killing.

Then on August 13, Rakib, 13, was tortured to death in Khulna, by his former employer just because the boy quit the job and started working elsewhere for better pay.

A Khulna court sentenced Sharif and Mintu to death for the murder.

In the first 10 months of last year, 261 children were murdered while 32 others were killed after being kidnapped, according to Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum, a leading network of child rights organisations.

They were expert bomb makers
The militants at Atia Mahal were expert bomb makers and the Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) found in the Sylhet den were all homemade, investigators have said.

The detonators of the IEDs were assembled in various militant hideouts in Sitakunda of Chittagong and then brought to the Sylhet den.

The fact that militants were getting hold of the substance came to law enforcers' notice after a police checkpoint came under attack in Comilla on March 7, and the subsequent arrest of two terror suspects, they said asking not to be named.

Officials of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) suspect that large consignments of the gel entered Bangladesh in recent months.

�The entire building has become highly risky as they placed explosives in the staircase and different other places,� he told reporters at Sylhet's Jalalabad Cantonment in the evening.

Police claim �Neo JMB� is an offshoot of the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh (JMB), which carried out several large-scale attacks in 2001-2005.

Alim committed looting, arson
A victim yesterday testified that former Convention Muslim League leader Abdul Alim along with Pakistani army looted their house before torching it at Panchbibi, Joypurhat on April 20, 1971, as they were his political opponent in 1970's election.

Mustafizur Rahman Chowdhury, a former Awami League leader, told the International Crimes Tribunal-2 that Alim and other Peace Committee members welcomed Pakistani army at the neighbouring district and brought them to Panchbibi, where they killed many people.

Mustafizur, 14th prosecution witness in the case against Alim, a former member of late president Ziaur Rahman's cabinet, said agitated people attacked Alim's house at Joypurhat town in the evening of April 20, 1971 after they had heard about the attack on Panchbibi.

But people could not pick up Alim as he had fled, said the 70-year-old retired schoolteacher from Panchbibi.

During his 35-minute testimony, Mustafizur said he was the organising secretary of Panchbibi upazila Awami League as well as a schoolteacher in 1971.

He said his father late Meheruddin Chowdury was the founder president of Awami League in Panchbibi and from 1954 to 1971, his father was involved in AL activities.

His father was the member of Panchbibi All Party Movement Committee during the Liberation War, said Mustifizur, adding that his father was the chief agent of AL candidate Mafiz Chowdhury from Panchbibi in 1970's election.

The witness said their home was a quarter mile away from Panchbibi Police Station.

"As our family worked against Abdul Alim in the election, for this reason, when Pakistani army entered Panchbibi on April 20, 1971, along with them [Pakistani army] Alim Shaheb attacked our house around 4:30-5:00pm that day, looted and torched our house," he added.

Mustafizur said he was in Joypurhat town during the attack and had heard people were attacking Alim's house around 6:30pm on that day.

As Mustafizur had asked the attackers, they told him that people attacked the house as Alim along with Pakistani army attacked Mustafizur's house, said the witness, adding that he had heard about the matter from advocate Anisur Rahman.

He also learned that Alim along with Joybar Ali Akand and Ayub Bihari from Panchbibi, who later became members of Peace Committee, an anti-liberation force, welcomed Pakistani army at Ghoraghat in Dinajpur around 2:00-2:30pm on April 20, 1971 and brought them to Panchbibi Market, where they killed many people.

He said three or four days after the incident, he had gone to India and found his parents at a refugee camp there and returned to the country after liberation.

Oles Buzyna, 45, was killed by shots fired from a car, Ukrainian Interior Minister Anton Herashchenko said.

9 Pakistani Taliban killed in US drone strike
A US drone strike killed at least nine Pakistani militants in Afghanistan�s Nangarhar province early Tuesday, intelligence officials said, part of an intensifying drone campaign against Pakistani militants in Afghanistan.

Tuesday's drone strike was near the site of fierce fighting on the Pakistani side of the border in recent days.

Two Pakistani intelligence officials confirmed Tuesday's strike in the Nazyan area of Nangarhar near Pakistan's Khyber Agency.

They said the nine militants belonged to the Pakistani Taliban and Lashkar-e-Islam, which announced an alliance with the Taliban earlier this month.

No one tracks drone strikes in Afghanistan - many of them take place in remote regions and are not reported - but Taliban commanders say that fighters there are being increasingly targeted since late last year.

The strikes come amid warming relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, traditionally hostile neighbors who each accuse the other of harboring insurgents to act as proxy forces.

Relations improved after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was elected last year.

Pakistan says it is supporting potential peace talks between the Afghan government and Afghan Taliban.

Diplomats hope Pakistan can pressure Afghan Taliban with bases in Pakistan to negotiate.

But Pakistan has also said it wants to see action taken against Pakistani insurgents with bases in Afghanistan.
