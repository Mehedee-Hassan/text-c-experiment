nltk 73|Zahedul I Khan The laws governing violence against women have made their presence in Bangladesh.

nltk 73|Violence against women has a history in Bangladesh.

nltk 73|It is also something that women face worldwide; The Egyptian Center for Women's Rights reported that 83% of their women faced street harassment at least once in their life, and similar statistics were found for South Africa, Mexico and France, to name a few.

nltk 73|With urbanisation and the rapid population growth in Dhaka, women inevitably become more prominent in the streets.

nltk 73|This trend is certainly a triumph in the modern women's movement of Bangladesh.

nltk 73|It is very evident therefore, that the ratio of the two genders in the streets of Dhaka is still overwhelmingly in favour of men.

nltk 73|As one male student in his third year at Dhaka University (anonymous) explained after asking him about street harassment, ‚Äúthese women are not supposed to be in the streets, so of course they are going to get harassed.

nltk 73|Aisha Zakira, the founder of HollaBack in Mumbai in their press release explained how street harassment incidents ‚Äúare rarely reported, and are culturally accepted as 'the price you pay' for being a woman and living in a city like Mumbai.‚Äù She further went on to explain how this type of violence is a ‚Äúgateway crime‚Äù which creates a ‚Äúcultural environment which makes gender-based violence okay,‚Äù and how while a legal method exists in countries like India and Bangladesh to tackle abuse at work or home, ‚Äúwhen it comes to the streets -- all bets are off.‚Äù Women are also being told to ignore by other women, as commonly observed by mothers and other older female family members.

nltk 73|Let us assume that public transportation has suddenly become much safer in Bangladesh, for men and women: the rate of hijacking, robbery and threat has significantly decreased, if any at all still occur.
